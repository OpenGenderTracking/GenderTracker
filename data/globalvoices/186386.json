He then came up with other demands and opinions while piggy backing on nationalism and homeland security issues to gain support.\n\nAnd it somehow worked. He gained some support from legislators, local politicians, and some of the people who were initially skeptical about his initial demand. According to IT consultant Daniel Tumiwa , some of Tifatul's demands are already complied by RIM. Here (id) are several of the demands and Daniel's twitter arguments summarized by Baban Sarbana:\n TS: Kita minta RIM agar buka perwakilan di Indonesia, karena pelanggan RIM di Indonesia untuk Blackberry sdh lbh dari 2 juta. #RIM\nDT: #RIM sdh buka kantor Okt 10. BKKPM hadir. Dibuka olh Menteri Keuangan Kanada. Bpk Tidak hadir?\nTS: Kita Minta RIM agar membuka service center di Indonesia untuk melayani &amp; mudahkan pelanggan mereka yg juga WNI. #RIM\nDT: RIM sudah punya belasan Srvc Center dan akan punya lebih dr 30 di thn ‘11. Done.\nTS: Kita minta RIM agar merekrut dan menyerap tenaga kerja Indonesia secara layak dan proporsional. #RIM\nDT: Done. Setahu sy Expat hanya 2. Sisa staff WNI. Done.\nTS: Kita minta RIM agar sebanyak mungkin menggunakan konten lokal Indonesia, khususnya mengenai software. #RIM\n T: RIM should open a representative office in Indonesia to cater more than 2 million Blackberry users\nD: RIM innaugurated its Indonesian representative in October 2010, attended by Canadian Finance Minister and  The Coordinating Board for Investment (BKPM). Weren't you there?\nT: RIM should open service center in Indonesia.\nD: RIM has dozens of service centers, will reach 30 in 2011. Done.\nT: RIM should hire local workers.\nD: Done. There are only 2 expat managers while the rest are Indonesian citizens.\nT: RIM should use local content and softwares.\nD: RIM is not a content provider, but handset maker and service provider.\nBlogger Rob Baiton who blogs at The RAB Experience, found Tifatul's crusade \"bizarre\":\n So desperate is TitS (author's note: blogger's nickname for Tifatul Sembiring) to beat down RIM he has gone outside his mandate to try and portray this spat as one that has a nationalist pride angle to it. In fact, TitS has decided that, in his opinion, RIM is a marauding infidel invader that has only come to Indonesia to rape and pillage her of her resources and wealth, and pay no taxes into the bargain.\n\nTaxes are generally the domain of the Minister For Finance, and perhaps the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, but generally taxes are not the primary concern of ministers in other fields. In light of the TitS charge, it is worth asking whether RIM pays its dues. The reality is, if RIM has not been paying its financial obligations then why has it taken a spat over porn filters to make this publicly known?\n\nThumbnail from the Flickr page of basibanget used under CC License Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)",
