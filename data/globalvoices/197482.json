The media then accused the Egyptian protesters of having Iranian, Israeli, and American agendas. They also claimed that they all belong to Hamas and to the Muslim Brotherhood. Abdulla Otaibi from Kuwait wrote how the protesters in Bahrain are accused of having Iranian agendas too: \n\n @aotaibi: للأسف مؤيدي السلطات البحرينية، لايملكون سوى فزاعة التخويف من \"الشيعة\" وأنهم يتبعون \"ولاية الفقيه\" الايرانية، نفس قصة الاخوان المسلمين بمصر\n @aotaibi: Unfortunately: Those who support the regime in Bahrain have nothing to do but scaring people of the Shia protesters and saying that they follow Iran's religious leaders commands.

Abu-Allan doesn't think they learnt anything:\n\n النظام السياسي في البحرين وغيره من الأنظمة العربية لا تريد التعلم أو  الاتعاظ مما جرى في تونس ومصر، ولا يريدون الاقتناع أن الشعوب إن هبت طلباً للحرية لا يمكن أن تكسر شوكتها مهما بلغ حجم القتل أو الاعتقال بين المحتجين، لا بل أصبحت الممارسات القمعية لأجهزة الأمن العربية بمثابة الوقود لهذه الثورات الشعبية ضد أنظمة الظلم والفساد. \n The political regime in Bahrain, like other Arab regimes refuses to learn the lessons from what happened in Tunisia and Egypt. They do not want to understand that when people ask for their freedom, detention and murder will never be able to stop them. In fact, the brutal reactions of the Arab security forces are now more like fuel for the people's revolutions against unjust and corruption. \n\nMichael Habib also wrote: \n\n @maverickzz: There has to be an Arab Dictator Handbook out there. I can't believe they are all thinking the same way, same orders, out of Luck.\n\nAnd finally, Essam El-Zamel from Saudi Arabia, agrees with both Abu-Allan and Habib. He believes that this pattern makes it easy to predict the regimes final destination: \n\n @essamz: نفس الأخطاء تتكرر في البحرين:مطالب مشروعة ومعقولة للمتظاهرين، تجابه بتصرفات حمقاء وعنف من قبل الحكومة،ترتفع المطالب ثم يختفي النظام\n @essamz:Same mistakes are being repeated in Bahrain. Reasonable and legal demands of the protesters are faced with stupid and brutal reactions from the government. The ceiling of the demands then get raised higher and higher, and finally the regime falls.\n\n This post is part of our special coverage of Bahrain Protests 2011. ",

      "But the question is, does this resemblance help the regime to learn from each other's mistakes?",
      "Abu-Allan doesn't think they learnt anything:\n\n النظام السياسي في البحرين وغيره من الأنظمة العربية لا تريد التعلم أو  الاتعاظ مما جرى في تونس ومصر، ولا يريدون الاقتناع أن الشعوب إن هبت طلباً للحرية لا يمكن أن تكسر شوكتها مهما بلغ حجم القتل أو الاعتقال بين المحتجين، لا بل أصبحت الممارسات القمعية لأجهزة الأمن العربية بمثابة الوقود لهذه الثورات الشعبية ضد أنظمة الظلم والفساد.",
      "The political regime in Bahrain, like other Arab regimes refuses to learn the lessons from what happened in Tunisia and Egypt.",
      "They do not want to understand that when people ask for their freedom, detention and murder will never be able to stop them.",
      "In fact, the brutal reactions of the Arab security forces are now more like fuel for the people's revolutions against unjust and corruption.",
      "Michael Habib also wrote: \n\n @maverickzz: There has to be an Arab Dictator Handbook out there.",
      "I can't believe they are all thinking the same way, same orders, out of Luck.",
      "And finally, Essam El-Zamel from Saudi Arabia, agrees with both Abu-Allan and Habib.",
      "He believes that this pattern makes it easy to predict the regimes final destination: \n\n @essamz: نفس الأخطاء تتكرر في البحرين:مطالب مشروعة ومعقولة للمتظاهرين، تجابه بتصرفات حمقاء وعنف من قبل الحكومة،ترتفع المطالب ثم يختفي النظام\n @essamz:Same mistakes are being repeated in Bahrain.",
      "Reasonable and legal demands of the protesters are faced with stupid and brutal reactions from the government.",
      "The ceiling of the demands then get raised higher and higher, and finally the regime falls.",
