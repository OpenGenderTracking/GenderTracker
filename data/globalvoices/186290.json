Throughout the year Navalny’s blog published a number of  brave and unusually informed investigations of government corruption. Undoubtedly, however, his most significant work was the one that focused on Transneft, the state company responsible for managing the country’s oil pipelines. In this one investigation alone, Navalny’s blog highlighted $4 billion worth of alleged theft, fixed tenders and dubious accounting. Not without reason, Time magazine referred to him as \"Russia's Erin Brockovich\".\n\nWhile opponents pointed to an alleged nationalist past, and his own admission that he would accept money from businessmen to investigate rival companies, Navalny’s stock has never been higher. In October, he was elected “virtual mayor of Moscow” by readers of the influential news sites gazeta.ru and Kommersant Daily. The e-zine OpenSpace.ru declared him their “Hero of 2010.\" [RUS] As the year turned, Navalny opened his own anti-corruption portal rospil.info [RUS], designed, in Wikileaks fashion, to highlight suspicious civil service tenders.\n “Government has lost the moral and intellectual competition on the Internet.

Such experience no doubt explains Litvinovich’s unusual ability to spot the big story, able to turn an obscure posting from a little-known blogger into the story everyone is talking about.\n\nLast year saw Litvinovich launch BestToday.ru, a web aggregator monitoring the Russian blogosphere. The site has since popularised and supported a number of successful online campaigns: turning a car accident on Leningradsky Prospect into a trial of oligarch impunity; forcing a second trial in the outrageous case of Anna Shavenkova, who caused another car accident yet escaped punishment because of political ties; and exposing the scandal of police who used people as a “live barrier” to catch a speeding motorist. In the short time of its existence, BestToday.ru has become a popular resource among Russian internet users.\n\nLitvinovich was also one of the leading figures behind “Help Map”, a crowdsourcing platform developed during last summer’s wildfires. This resource, based on Ushahidi, connected volunteers with villages and regions that needed urgent assistance. Help Map demonstrated the growing power and solidarity of the Russian online community, in stark contrast with the bankruptcy and passivity of large parts of the state.\n “If people see something as threatening enough to them personally, and the government also demonstrates ineffectiveness, the next step is for people to self-organize”\nRead GV interview with Marina Litvinovich here.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_186623\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"100\" caption=\"Ilya Varlamov, LiveJournal userpic\"][/caption]\n\nIlya Varlamov (LJ user zyalt [RUS]) \n\nThe youngest blogger in our selection, 26-year old photojournalist Ilya Varlamov has become a cult figure of the Russian online.

His ability to deliver such complete visual histories in superquick time and easily multipliable format have earned him the informal title \"Eye of the RuNet”.\n\nWhile his photo-reportages have often carried an intensely political feel, Varlamov has himself never actually expressed a civic position, nor made an overt political stand on any issue. Indeed, he has even been invited onto the government press pool and granted access to the Kremlin office of Putin’s controversial lieutenant Vladislav Surkov.\n\nDespite the absence of an obvious civic position, Varlamov has shown that the blogosphere can easily rival conventional media in its illustrativity and credibility.

Since then, he has remained involved at the cutting edge of the industry, most notably as ambassador for the SUP publishing company, which manages LiveJournal.com, the leading and almost monopolistic hosting service for Russian blogs.\n\nNossik has always been a fierce advocate of internet freedoms, and last year made a number of important interventions drawing awareness to threats and realities of online censorship. His blog rallied against the suspicious suspensions of LiveJournal user accounts [RUS], the gradual turning of the censor screws [RUS] in the former Soviet Union generally, and the dubious deals that accompanied the launch of cyrillic domain addresses [RUS].\n\nNossik made a particularly successful intervention in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, which turned out to be instrumental in preventing a ban on the YouTube.

His coup de grace was the expose of Ruslan Gattarov, senator and leading light of Molodaya Gvardiya, United Russia’s youth wing. At a time that Russia was facing an ecological nightmare of uncontrollable forest fires, this young apparatchik released several pictures of him supposedly putting his life fighting some of these fires. Nazarov showed Gattarov had, in fact, deliberately set some trees on fire to make for a flattering photo-shoot. The embarassing revelation brought about Gattarov’s removal from Molodaya Gvardiya’s top table.\n\nIn another example of smart digital journalism, Nazarov helped identify a gang of hooligans who were targeting lone drivers in the neighbouring city of Yekaterinburg. The attitude of the police varied from ignorance to incompetence, but Nazarov led a brilliant investigation, using photos and data collected from victims to lead him back to the criminals’ odnoklassniki social networking accounts. The evidence he uncovered was sensational, and led back to members of the United Russia party in the Tyumen region. After Nazarov’s investigation, police were forced into action and arrested one of the offenders. The blogger is also one of the founders of the mejdurechensk LiveJournal community, a space for free discussion of the hottest political topics.\n\nIn November 2010, Valeriy Nazarov’s LiveJournal account was controversially suspended. The hosting site have yet to come up with a satisfactory explanation why it closed one of the most read blogs on the RuNet; and Nazarov’s case has since been taken up by a number of fellow bloggers. That is not to say that the suspension in any way silenced him. Following the LiveJournal decision, Nazarov multiplied his presence, duplicating the blog on Twitter [RUS], Facebook [RUS], Blogspot.com [RUS] and lj.rossia.org [RUS].\n “Effective and fast justice is possible only on the Internet”\n\nValeriy Nazarov [RUS]\n[caption id=\"attachment_186600\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"100\" caption=\"Oleg Kozyrev, photo by Sergey Yushenkov\"][/caption]\n\nOleg Kozyrev (LJ user oleg-kozyrev [RUS])\n\nOleg Kozyrev, 38, is a professional blogger, writer and journalist.

      "Undoubtedly, however, his most significant work was the one that focused on Transneft, the state company responsible for managing the country’s oil pipelines.",
      "In this one investigation alone, Navalny’s blog highlighted $4 billion worth of alleged theft, fixed tenders and dubious accounting.",
      "Not without reason, Time magazine referred to him as \"Russia's Erin Brockovich\".",
      "While opponents pointed to an alleged nationalist past, and his own admission that he would accept money from businessmen to investigate rival companies, Navalny’s stock has never been higher.",
      "In October, he was elected “virtual mayor of Moscow” by readers of the influential news sites gazeta.ru",
      "and Kommersant Daily.",
      "The e-zine OpenSpace.ru",
      "declared him their “Hero of 2010.\"",
      "[RUS] As the year turned, Navalny opened his own anti-corruption portal rospil.info",
      "[RUS], designed, in Wikileaks fashion, to highlight suspicious civil service tenders.",

      "Such experience no doubt explains Litvinovich’s unusual ability to spot the big story, able to turn an obscure posting from a little-known blogger into the story everyone is talking about.",
      "Last year saw Litvinovich launch BestToday.ru, a web aggregator monitoring the Russian blogosphere.",
      "The site has since popularised and supported a number of successful online campaigns: turning a car accident on Leningradsky Prospect into a trial of oligarch impunity; forcing a second trial in the outrageous case of Anna Shavenkova, who caused another car accident yet escaped punishment because of political ties; and exposing the scandal of police who used people as a “live barrier” to catch a speeding motorist.",
      "In the short time of its existence, BestToday.ru has become a popular resource among Russian internet users.",
      "Litvinovich was also one of the leading figures behind “Help Map”, a crowdsourcing platform developed during last summer’s wildfires.",
      "This resource, based on Ushahidi, connected volunteers with villages and regions that needed urgent assistance.",
      "Help Map demonstrated the growing power and solidarity of the Russian online community, in stark contrast with the bankruptcy and passivity of large parts of the state.",

      "Varlamov’s distinctive offer is to combine news quality with aesthetic illustration, and to deliver it in the fastest and most accessible way via his blog.",
      "His ability to deliver such complete visual histories in superquick time and easily multipliable format have earned him the informal title \"Eye of the RuNet”.",
      "While his photo-reportages have often carried an intensely political feel, Varlamov has himself never actually expressed a civic position, nor made an overt political stand on any issue.",
      "Indeed, he has even been invited onto the government press pool and granted access to the Kremlin office of Putin’s controversial lieutenant Vladislav Surkov.",
      "Despite the absence of an obvious civic position, Varlamov has shown that the blogosphere can easily rival conventional media in its illustrativity and credibility.",
      "Varlamov not alone in this trend: other leading photobloggers worth taking a look at include drugoi, ottenki_serogo, and igorpodgorny.",

      "the leading and almost monopolistic hosting service for Russian blogs.",
      "Nossik has always been a fierce advocate of internet freedoms, and last year made a number of important interventions drawing awareness to threats and realities of online censorship.",
      "His blog rallied against the suspicious suspensions of LiveJournal user accounts [RUS], the gradual turning of the censor screws [RUS] in the former Soviet Union generally, and the dubious deals that accompanied the launch of cyrillic domain addresses [RUS].",
      "Nossik made a particularly successful intervention in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, which turned out to be instrumental in preventing a ban on the YouTube.",
      "Regional prosecutors had used alleged extremist content in an attempt to justify the ban.",

      "His coup de grace was the expose of Ruslan Gattarov, senator and leading light of Molodaya Gvardiya, United Russia’s youth wing.",
      "At a time that Russia was facing an ecological nightmare of uncontrollable forest fires, this young apparatchik released several pictures of him supposedly putting his life fighting some of these fires.",
      "Nazarov showed Gattarov had, in fact, deliberately set some trees on fire to make for a flattering photo-shoot.",
      "The embarassing revelation brought about Gattarov’s removal from Molodaya Gvardiya’s top table.",
      "In another example of smart digital journalism, Nazarov helped identify a gang of hooligans who were targeting lone drivers in the neighbouring city of Yekaterinburg.",
      "The attitude of the police varied from ignorance to incompetence, but Nazarov led a brilliant investigation, using photos and data collected from victims to lead him back to the criminals’ odnoklassniki social networking accounts.",
      "The evidence he uncovered was sensational, and led back to members of the United Russia party in the Tyumen region.",
      "After Nazarov’s investigation, police were forced into action and arrested one of the offenders.",
      "The blogger is also one of the founders of the mejdurechensk LiveJournal community, a space for free discussion of the hottest political topics.",
      "In November 2010, Valeriy Nazarov’s LiveJournal account was controversially suspended.",
      "The hosting site have yet to come up with a satisfactory explanation why it closed one of the most read blogs on the RuNet; and Nazarov’s case has since been taken up by a number of fellow bloggers.",
      "That is not to say that the suspension in any way silenced him.",
      "Following the LiveJournal decision, Nazarov multiplied his presence, duplicating the blog on Twitter [RUS], Facebook [RUS], Blogspot.com",
