The main demonstration centred on Tahrir Square in Baghdad but there were similar protests all over the country. @ArabPeople wrote:\n #Iraq just started and it will surprise the entire #Arab world. No other revolt that started in 17+ locations. It's just the beginning.\nThe Iraqi Revolution Facebook page published a list of demands translated in full here which concludes with:\n WE WILL NOT ACCEPT PROMISES AFTER TODAY\n\n- We are fed up with political bids, we are fed up with honeyed promises, we are fed up with prosthetic decisions that some officials use to throw dust in the eyes of the people.\n\n- Empty promises will not satisfy the hungry, and the cheap bids will not put clothes on the naked, and the shinny slogans will not quench the thirst of liver behooves.\n\n- Silence is no longer a choice for any of us, so we will no be silenced after today…\n\n-So how long will the Iraqis be divided into two classes, one that eats the beef, and the other eats the leaf!!\n\n- And how long will a group of people receive multiple salaries, each salary covers a whole tribe, and the other people can’t get a single penny from the wealth of their homeland!!\n\n- And how long will a group will receive warmth from the fire caused by the process of burning the public funds while others are dying because of the cold at the night of winter!!\n\n- And how long will some enjoy the iced water in the heat of summer time while the others quench their thirst with the sewage water!!\n\nAS GOD IS OUR WITNESS..

I am SOLIDLY against this government now.\nKassakhoon believes that these demonstration are only the beginning:\n The demos also showed how the government is weak and terrified from the people when pushed thousands of security forces to seal off the roads, mainly the bridge that leads to the already heavily fortified Green Zone when erected tall concrete blast walls.\n\nNone of the government officials dared to show up before the demonstrators, but instead they only talked to State-run TV ...\n\nIt is right that today's protests ended on the ground, but they are still live inside the protesters. What we witnessed today was only a small ice ball that just started to roll and it will get bigger day after day.\nIn contrast to Maliki accusing the protestors of being supporters of Saddam, Layla Anwar the nearest thing among Iraqi bloggers to a Saddamist took a somewhat different view of the protests:\n Protest my ass. Where were you when the tanks rolled in ? where were you when the sectarian Shiites and their turbaned mullahs swayed you with a couple of hundred dollars for a finger dipped in purple ink for a \"democratic\" vote...\n\nWhere were you when we escaped in droves, living the lives of dogs in exile...where were you when the militias you praised and danced for decimated us all? Where the fuck were you?\n\nWhere were you when you let another sectarian whore from Iran take power again, for a second tenure and you sat and talked of national reconciliation and ballot boxes ?!\n\nWhere were you when the Iraqi Resistance was struggling against the invader ALONE ?\n\n...\n\nDemanding better living conditions from puppets is IDIOCY. Hundreds of foreign companies are making a living off your backs, bringing in their own staff and leaving you, so called educated class working as blue collars in your own country...\n\nSo where were you ? ...\n\nGive me a break you hypocrites.\n\nIraq is my biggest love and you are my biggest disappointment.\n\nGo protest as much as you like, I will not lend you my voice.
