The Rarámuri indian's name is said to mean those who run fast, and that has sparked the attention of runners who believe that by walking in the traditional Tarahumara's shoes, the huaraches, they may be able to tap onto their speed and resistance. \n\n\n\nThis previous video showed us a Tarahumara indian tying on his traditional huaraches: this next video shows a new incarnation of the huarache as readapted by the barefoot running page InvisibleShoe.\n\n\n\nThe Japanese also have their traditional sandals. These next videos show how to make zōri [jp], waraji(1 and 2)  and geta sandals (starts at 2:28) respectively:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wooden clogs or klompen have been part of Dutch identity and image for years. Here, we see how they are traditionally made using hand tools:\n\n\n\nThis short note shows us one of 4 traditional Peranakan beaded slippers makers of Singapore:\n\n\n\nBut not only traditional designs are made by hand as we can see in this next video. In Sri Lanka, traditional cobbling skills are put to work making modern shoes:\n\n\n\nAnd last but not least, a specialized shoe that is dreamed about by many little girls all over the world: the pointe ballerina shoe.\n\n",
