Zenobia broke the news of the explosion in her blog: \n\n I do not want to start the new year with bad news like this but just from an hour ago a huge explosion was heard in Miami area and according to early media report it was an explosion that took place in front of the All Saints church [Two Saints Church] at the Khalil Hamda street.\n\nSara El Sayeh, just like almost all of the Egyptian bloggers, expressed her anger over the bombing:\n\n Some ignorant, backward minded person decided to kill innocent people.

Meanwhile, the blogger in \"The Egypt Silent Majority\" had a different point of view: \n\n أكتب هذا الموضوع و لم يتم الكشف بعد عن ملابسات هذه الجريمة البشعة التي تم ارتكابها في حق ابناء مصر المسيحيين و لم يتم بعد كشف النقاب عن عناصر خارجية او داخلية وراء الحادث...الا ان في رأيي المتواضع فسواء كان هناك عناصر خارجية متورطة في هذا التفجير او عناصر داخلية...تنظيم القاعدة او اسرائيل....كل هذا لن يغير من واقع الأمر شيئا....كل هذا لا يجب ان ينسينا او يجعلنا نتغافل عن حقيقة مهمة الا وهي ان (في حاجة غلط)\n \n Here I write about the accident, and before the names of the ones behind this awful crime against the Egyptian Christians are revealed. It's not been known yet whether it's internal hands or foreign ones behind this accident. Whether it's foreign personnel or internal ones that has been involved in this accident, and no matter if it is Al Qaeda or Israel, this doesn't change that fact that there is something wrong in us.\nHe then continued to state the symptoms and evidence that prove that there is something wrong with the Egyptian society. And here are some of them: \n\n *عندما تندلع المعارك و الإشتباكات في كل مرة يريد فيها المسيحيون بناء كنيسة يتعبدوا و يصلوا فيها....يبقى اكيد في حاجة غلط..!!\n*عندما يعيش المسلمون و المسيحيون في هذا البلد و كل طائفة تتصور انها اصحاب البلد و الأخرون مجرد (ضيوف) او (غزاة)....يبقى دة غلط في غلط..!!\n*عندما تخرج قبل كل عيد من اعياد الأقباط فتاوى عجيبة تحرم تهنئة (الكفار) بعيدهم...يبقى اكيد في حاجة غلط...!!\n*عندما تغض الكنيسة الطرف عن محاضرات  بعض القساوسة المتطرفين الذين يبثوا سمومهم عن الإسلام و رسوله في الفضائيات المسيحية متجاهلة بذلك مشاعر ملايين المسلمين الغاضبين...يبقى اكيد في حاجة غلط...!!!\n * When there are clashes every time the Christians decide to build an new church to pray in ... then surely something is wrong.\n* When both of Muslims and Christians believe that this is just their own country and the other party is nothing but a guest or invader .... then surely something is wrong.\n* When in every Christian feast the scholars issue weird Fatwas calling them infidels and prohibiting Muslims from celebrating or congratulating them in it ... then surely something is wrong.\n* When the Church leaves those bishops who attack Islam and Prophet Muhammad all the time on satellite channels unquestioned  ... then surely something is wrong.\n\nAnd finally, the reactions everywhere whether on Facebook or offline, and those who called for Muslims to attend the Coptic Christians masses on the 7th of January [Ar] made Maggie Ossama believe that such incident will never be able to break the unity of the Egyptian people regardless of their religion or race: \n\n عايزة اقولها للفاعل المجهول انا مش عايزة اعرف انت مين لكن كل اللي عايزاه اني اقولك لو انت عملت كدا عشان تسبب فتنة طائفية فالمصريين ثبتولك العكس والمظاهرات اللي حصلت في طلعت حرب والعباسية وماسبيرو تشهد على كدا، مسيحيين ومسلمين خرجوا من بيوتهم وراحوا يتظاهروا ايد واحدة والناس اللي راحت اتبرعت بالدم للمصابين كانوا مسيحيين ومسلمين عشان احنا كلنا في الآخر مصريين دم واحد\n I want to tell the terrorist, whom I don't care about knowing his identity, that although your intention was to cause sectarian unrest, the Egyptians have proved to you that you were wrong with their demonstrations in downtown.
