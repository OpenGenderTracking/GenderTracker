  "body": "Two separate demonstrations, held in Amman, Jordan, on Friday, February 4th, ended peacefully.  This week saw King Abdullah II dismissing Prime Minister Samir Rifai, champion of economic liberalization, in favor of former Prime Minister Maarouf Bakhit.  Bakhit is of Jordanian origin and from a military background.  His appointment has been interpreted as a display of the King's desire to consolidate Jordan's loyalists and mollify those angry with rising food and energy costs.  Bakhit's appointment was not, however, met without complaint, with Islamists in particular charging that Bakhit is not capable of carrying out political reform.\n\nAfter Bakhit's appointment, the King further attempted to stave off Islamist criticism by meeting with Islamist opposition leaders.  After these actions, two separate protests were held the afternoon of Friday, February 4th.  The first was held downtown, the site of ongoing protests against (now former) PM Rifai.  This week, the protests were against the appointment of new PM Bakhit and in solidarity with the Egyptian people.  \n\nAt 12:30 pm Amman time, Mahmoud al-Hamawi  reported the events of the protest minute-by-minute, tweeting a series of slogans being chanted and displayed at the downtown protest:\n\n\n ما بدنا نغير حكومات ... بدنا نغير سياسات Downtown , amman now AngryJordan #ReformJO\n\n\n We don't want to change governments, we want to change politics\n\nHe continued for the next half hour, updating every couple of minutes with slogans both against the new prime minister and in solidarity with Egypt.

By 1:30, Ali Abu-Nimah tweeted:\n\n Estimate a couple thousand outside Egypt embassy in Amman despite heavy rain.
