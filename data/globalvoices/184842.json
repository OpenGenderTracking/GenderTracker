If Southern Sudan separates, African states will therefore increase from 53 to 54. The referendum is part the 2005 Naivasha Agreement between the Khartoum central government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement. \n\nThis is our latest roundup of blog posts related to the referendum. \n\nSpeaking at the University of Khartoum, Sudan, Thabo Mbeki, the Chairman of the African Union High Level Implementation Panel for Sudan (AUHIP), said that should Sudan divide, it will not divide into an \"African\" south and an \"Arab\" north and that Northern Sudan is not less \"African\" than Southern Sudan: \n\n In this context we would like to emphasise that should Sudan divide, it will not divide into an “African” south and an “Arab” north, still less into two states divided by adherence to different faiths. In the case of secession, the multi-ethnic, multi-religious African country of Sudan will divide into two countries, north and south, both of which are equally African, and both of which will of necessity embrace diversity.\n\nWe hold firmly to the view that northern Sudan is no less “African” than southern Sudan, and that Islam is a religion of Africa, just as the Arabs of Sudan and the Mahgreb are people of Africa. As pan-Africans we are proud of the achievements of the Arab and Muslim civilisations on this continent, which we regard as an integral part of our heritage. \n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_185197\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"533\" caption=\"Music for separation in Juba, Southern Sudan.

This is the first of two field dispatches examining ongoing developments that threaten to destabilize Unity state, arguably one of the most strategic areas of South Sudan.\n\nDavid Widgington of South Sudan Info links to online videos about the referendum and writes kenya pre-referendum information: \n\n \nAccording to a Sudan Tribune article posted on AllAfrica, a total of 3.9 million people have registered to vote. Numbers released by the Southern Sudan Referendum Commission (SSRC) a few days ago divide the figures into registrations in the south: 3.7 million, in the north: 116,000, and 60,000 in the diaspora: Australia, Canada, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, the UK and the USA. During the latest cencus, there is an estimated population of 8 million Southern Sudanese. For the referendum to be legimitate, 60% of registered voters need to participate in the vote.\n\nAs I follow events in Southern Sudan and add articles to my headlines timeline, people continually ask me basic questions about Sudan. Below I’ve included a few videos that have recently been posted online. They should provide a descent background for those wanting to learn more as Southern Sudanese are set to what is generally believed to choose to create Africa’s newest independent country.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_185201\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"263\" caption=\"Ballot symbols chosen for the Southern Sudan Referendum.
