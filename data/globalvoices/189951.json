Numbers in thousands. #jan25 #suez\nA lot of Twitter coverage on #jan25 is in English, suggesting that it is being used for amplification and international news purposes, rather than for organizational purposes on the ground.

Please RT so we can get more people to read it. #Egypt #Jan25\n \nSalama's story is itself a media event; both a graphic account the beating he took by police, and a self-observed and reported view of himself as demonstrator. He begins his story by identifying himself as playing a role:\n The street was totally vacant of people, and in the horizon I could see a  mass of people. At first I thought they were protesters but then I  noticed that they all were dressed in black, coming in our direction and  holding black sticks. I remembered the scenes from old war movies, like  Braveheart and Gladiator, and I had the exact feeling of old battle  grounds, and I found myself one of the first people to run towards the  approaching lines of police.\nSalama's story quickly turns grim. He changes roles, from action hero to war reporter to victim:\n I had my dear iPhone in hand, and I was trying to take photos or record  videos, until I got surrounded by a large enough amount of soldiers who  started beating me ferociously with their sticks, delivering painful  blows on my head, face, stomach and legs.\nAs the beating continues, Salama is dragged off the street and beaten multiple times:\n Then we entered a building, the nice soldiers escorting, he locked  the entrance, tripped my legs and got me on the ground, then started the  painful episode of vicious beating.\nHe reports that he begins to imagine himself as a social media martyr:\n Visions about my family, how this was going to affect them, about the  movie that I hadn’t finished directing yet, about the page that would be  created about me on Facebook, and I wondered if it would have the title  “We all are Amr Salama”. I also thought about the statement the  Ministry of Interior would issue, saying that I must have died after  accidently swallowing my iPhone.\nSaved by some of the soldiers, he is able to escape. He then pinpoints his motives:\n I discovered that the most important thing is that I realized these  things, that I know why I was beaten, why I protested, and that I know  that without signs and complex political demands I understood why I  endured all this. I endured all this because I want a better Egypt, a  better Egypt without absolute ongoing power to anyone of its governors,  and a better Egypt without a large gap in social structure.\nNora Shalaby contributes a Flickr set that shows a different face of protest.
