  "body": "A number of South Africans have responded to Sentletse Diakanyo's post entitled \"We are not all Africans, black people are!\" We wrote a roundup of his post here. \n\n\nMarius Redelinghuys, a political science lecturer at Midrand Graduate Institute who calls himself \"Alternative Afrikaner\", blames Wikipedia and Google for Sentletse's Wiki’ed or Googled \"original thought\":\n\n\n\n\n \nI blame Wikipedia and Google which have instilled in some the\narrogance to think their Wiki’ed or Googled “original thought” places\nthem on par with leading academics in their various fields.\n\n\nSentletse's post reads like an excerpt from an apartheid-era history textbook:\n \nThe most recent perversion, near-rape, of paleoanthropology,\nevolutionary biology and population genetics is done by none other\nthan our very own Sentletse Diakanyo. His latest rant entitled “We are\nnot all Africans, black people are!” reads like an excerpt from an\napartheid-era history textbook.\n\n\n\nMarius notes that all modern humans have a direct ancestry linked to Africa:\n\n All studies of global mtDNA divergence have shown that\nAfrican populations have the biggest mtDNA divergence (followed by\nAsian and European populations). The fact that Africans have the\ngreatest mtDNA sequence variations proves they have amassed the most mtDNA mutations, providing compelling evidence for the idea of African origin of humankind because the population with the most diversity is almost certainly the ancestral population and all other population groups seem to be subsets of the diversity found in Africa, further buttressing the argument for an African origin.\n\n\nHe concludes by telling Sentletse that whether he likes it or not, we are all Africans:\n\n \nContinents, countries and race are social constructions, and underneath it all, we’re all humans: humans who came out of Africa. We\nare all Africans, Mr Diakanyo, whether you like it or not.\n\nJason van Niekerk, a lecturer in the philosophy department at Wits University, responds to Sentletse's post by discussing the problem with defining the term \"African\": \n\n\n There are a couple of problems here, but the essential one is that his argument rests on what’s called the fallacy of\nequivocation, a sleight-of-word trick that takes a word with multiple\nmeanings, makes a point about one, then substitutes the other, like\nthis: the rich are the enemy of the people. Cheesecake is rich.\nTherefore, cheesecake is the enemy of the people. In much the same\nway, Diakanyo shows that “African” has at least one accepted meaning, picking out black people, then insists that this should be its only meaning in all contexts. But, of course, we use the term in many\ncontexts, and collapsing all of them to the racial one wouldn’t work\n(here’s the party-trick reason: African Penguins are black AND white,\nbut African all over). As many of Diakanyo’s respondents have noted,\nthe sense in which some white people contend that they are African\nseems to pick out some sort of relationship to Africa and Africans,\nrather than an insistence that they be considered black.\n\n\nIs it enough to use the term \"African\" in a geographic sense?:\n\n \n....note that exactly the same fallacy shows up in the most common\nwhite whine generated in response to Diakanyo’s claim: “I’m South\nAfrican, I was born in Africa, so I’m as African as anyone else born\nhere.” See the trick? We can use “African” in a geographic sense, so\nthat must settle the question of whether we’re African in all senses.\nThat’s the same fallacy Diakanyo used. \n\n\nHe says, \"Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean that white people can’t be African, any more than my being a man necessarily prevents my being a feminist\":\n\n  But however much I subscribe to the radical notion that\nwomen are human beings, however much Steinem and Sontag and Greer I read, being a man insulates me from the impact of women’s experience in a way that being a woman never could. Now, it may well be that I cannot, as a matter of principle, opt out of a commitment to feminism, even if it’s an option, but I’d be a bit of a whiny git to pretend I can’t see why being a man might make it harder to prove my commitment.\nAnd in the same way, many white South Africans want to claim an\nAfrican identity not because they think they deserve it by default,\nbut because they really do care about Africa and Africans, because\nthey feel proud when this continent outperforms racist expectations,\nand deeply hurt when it seems to embody them.\n\n\n\nHis conclusion:\n So where does this leave us? White South Africans can’t\ninsist that they are automatically African, because that undermines\nthe value of a hard-won identity. But when black South Africans deny\nthe possibility of white Africans, they cut off the possibility of a\nnon-racist post-apartheid identity that millions of white people want\n(so badly that they insist they already embody it). And nobody wins by\ninsisting on what African means, while others who have a stake in that\nidentity disagree, because this identity depends on mutual\nrecognition.\n\nThe way out is for South Africans, black and white, to try to work out\nwhat our consensual understanding of “African” really is.\n\n\n\nChris Roper refutes Sentletse's argument that whites want to be classified as African. He says that white people merely want to identify with the ideological construct that is Africa:\n\n\n This is a lie, of course. White people, and everyone else\nwho was born on this continent and loves it, for all its many faults,\nhave merely wanted to identify with the general ideological construct\nthat is Africa. Which means embracing its many contradictions, and\nbeing willing to be part of the ever-evolving understandings of what\n\"Africa\" means in the world.\n\n\nThe term \"African\" has always being ambiguous:\n That's the point of these terms, they're always contested\nby various interest groups seeking to use them for their own ends. In\nyour case, apparently to antagonise South Africans who are trying to\nachieve some sort of commonality with their fellow citizens, both\nnational and continental, so that they can work together to build a\nviable life.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- I'm also nauseated by people who claim to be\nAfrican when we're hosting a World Cup, but mysteriously become South African when asked to account for kids having their hands lopped off in Rwanda. It's bad enough being asked to believe in a country, but a continent? And there's nothing more irritating than some white oke who thinks that the Castle beer ad is \"moving\", and who claims to love African music because he owns a Juluka CD.\n\n\nHis conclusion:Zombie Verwoerd stalks the Internet and the country. Hendrik Verwoerd was Prime Minister of South Africa from 1958 until his assassination in 1966.\n\n \nThe spirit of Hendrik Verwoerd still haunts this country and the\ninternet, a zombie stumbling around feeding off the grim life force\nthat is intolerance and racism. Every time we get bitten, or as in the\ncase of this column, take the bait, we create more hate-filled\nzombies. Ah well, at least when we have all fed off each other's pain,\nwe can then, truly, say \"We are all zombies\". But we won't be\nhuman.\n\nSarah Britten, who has unfriended Sentlese on Facebook and blocked him on Twitter, worries about the attention the media gives him. She says, \"He’s just a blogger and (let’s face it) blogging is not the same as appearing on the opinion page of the Sunday papers\":\n\n\n Yes, it’s important to acknowledge a range of views, and\nit’s important that they be aired so that they can be challenged. But\nlet’s be honest here: is Sentletse actually worthy of being quoted in\nthe serious media, the Mail &amp; Guardians and 702s of this world? He’s\nnot an academic or a politician, and there’s no clear platform from\nwhich he speaks. What exactly is the source of his authority? I don’t\nsee it. He’s just a blogger and (let’s face it) blogging is not the\nsame as appearing on the opinion page of the Sunday papers.\n\nAll this media coverage is serving less to promote debate and more to\ncreate a potential monster. Knowing Mo, he is chuckling throatily\nright now, enjoying every minute of it.\n\n\nSipho Hlongwane responds with a light touch congratulating \"President Sentletse Diakanyo\" who \"battled a fierce and hostile media, courts, intellectuals and outraged white, Indian and Chinese people\":\n\n\n He even battled against leaders from other countries in\nAfrica in the famous “Most of You Aren’t Really Africans” debate at\nthe 2012 African Union summit and reasserted South Africa’s position\nas African Country Most Full of Shit.\n\nHe concludes:\n The convenor of the Friends of Sentletse, Samora Castro\nAfrika (who is now rumoured to have a R9 billion telecommunications\ntender from the government) said they wouldn’t stop at changing the\nConstitution. “If only black people can be Africans, it naturally\nfollows that only Africans can have any claim to African land. We will\nnot rest until it is only Africans who are allowed into African malls,\nAfrican gyms and African suburban swimming pools. Aluta continua.”\n\nSo, congratulations again, President Sentletse. Your wise and\neffective leadership has finally laid to rest the ghost of our\nun-African past. Long may you continue to define us. \n\n\nKhaya Dlanga, an award winning blogger, says a white person can be an African:\n\n What does the dictionary define an African as? “Noun:\nAfrican - A native or inhabitant of Africa.” Since we have established\nthe definition of an African perhaps we should also define what a\nnative is. “Noun: native - 1. A person born in a particular place or\ncountry. 2. An indigenous person who was born in a particular place.”\n\nWhat do we conclude from this? If a white person is born in a\nparticular country in Africa, that white person is a native of that\ncountry. Since they happen to have been born in a country in Africa\nthat means they are African.\n\n\nHe says Sentletse does not define what an African is:\n \nThe writer of the blog doesn’t really define what an African is. His\nanswer is a simplistic “if you are black you are African”. There is no\nacknowledgement of the complexities of blackness. He has not\nconsidered the black people of Papua New Guinea for example. These\npeople did not really originate from Africa, yet they look as black as\nSentletse and me. The question then needs to be asked, are people from Papua New Guinea considered African? Scientists claim that these\npeople have their origins in South East Asia some 70 000 years\nago.\n\n\n\nThere is no such thing as pure race:\n\n Scientists today claim that there is in fact only one\nrace, the human race. Separating ourselves by physical appearance has no scientific basis. In 1943, Ruth Benedict and Gene Wetfish published “Races of Mankind” in which they claim that there is actually no race because most people in the world have in-between-skin colour.\nTherefore there is hardly any pure race if one wishes to use race.\nEven Africans aren’t pure because of the mixing that has taken place\nover time.\n\n\nFollowing online reactions to his post, Sentletse Diakanyo wrote\nanother blog post entitled \"The imagined threat of ‘die swart gevaar’\". \n\nSwart Gevaar (Afrikaans for black threat) was a term used during the days of the Apartheid South African regime to refer to the perceived security threat of the majority black, African population to the white South African government.\n\nHe says that he was not surprised to see \"the panic-stricken reaction\" to his post:\n It was actually not surprising to see the panic-stricken\nreaction to the article I wrote that “We are not all Africans, black\npeople are!” People responded not to the salient features and actual\ncontent of the article but to their own irrational fears of what could\nbe implied and the motivation behind whatever it is they imagined was\nimplied in the article. This is a problem with living in a paranoid\nsociety that is still haunted by its demons of its racist past.\n\nThere was a deliberate intent not to discuss the issues raised in the\narticle, but rather to embark on mindless attempts at character\nassassination in order to distract other readers who had full control\nof their mental faculties and the ability to regulate their\nemotions\n\n\nHe continues:\n These hysterical respondents seem to believe that because racial categorisation was used in the past for nefarious ends, that because the apartheid regime enforced through brute force the\npreservation of white privilege and entrenchment of white supremacy\nand Afrikaner Nationalist ideology, these very same things would be\nrepeated by liberated Africans. Africans are not the “barbarians and\nsavages” they had been portrayed to be in the past through “die swart\ngevaar” propaganda or through collective brainwashing of minorities\nback then.\n\n\nHe argues that official documents in South Africa are clear in how they define Africans:\n\n After all the noise, the kicking and screaming, the fact\nremains what they were and what will continue to be in the near\nfuture. The Broad Based Economic Empowerment Act and the Employment Equity Act is unequivocal in its definition of black people, who are “Africans, coloureds and Indians”. The mid-year population estimates by Statistics South Africa clearly distinguishes the population in terms of how it’s racially defined: Africans, whites, coloureds and Asians (Indians and Chinese). What’s with the hysteria?\n\nThose who see their commitment to Africa as being defined by the\nidentity — “Africans” — should refocus their energy towards\nunderstanding and embracing all that is African; closing the racial\ngap and making a concerted effort to not merely tolerate other races\nbut be part of them. That today we still have the majority of whites\nin South Africa who struggle to pronounce African names, never mind\nspeak fluently at least one African language, is a shame. It raises\nquestions about the claimed “Africanness”, commitment to national\nunity and general patriotism. \n\n\nIn responding to Sentletse's second post, Marius Redelinghuys says, \"We’re not all Africans, we’re Jews!\":\n In his subsequent response it becomes clear that it in\nfact is not a scientific discussion of human biological origins but is\ninstead, as I argued, an empty political argument that used “science”\nas a crutch: “That today we still have the majority of whites in South\nAfrica who struggle to pronounce African names, never mind speak\nfluently at least one African language, is a shame.”\n\nSo it’s really not about human evolution, but rather a political\nstatement about identity. Fine, I thought as much, so please leave\nscience out of it.\n\nBeyond this lack of conceptual clarity there is the issue of cognitive\ndissonance, selective reasoning and even inconsistencies in his\nargument (which makes me wonder who is guilty of an emotional and\nirrational outburst).\n\nThese inconsistencies are rather sad, considering the man on the one\nhand held that white people are of Chinese origin, therefore not black\nand especially not African. In his follow-up he switches from arguing\nfrom science to arguing from legislation (which is not, by the way,\nscientific or dependent on evidence) and informs us that “[t]he Broad\nBased Economic Empowerment Act and the Employment Equity Act is\nunequivocal in its definition of black people, who are ‘Africans,\ncoloureds and Indians’ “.

The Broad Based Economic Empowerment Act and the Employment Equity Act is unequivocal in its definition of black people, who are “Africans, coloureds and Indians”. The mid-year population estimates by Statistics South Africa clearly distinguishes the population in terms of how it’s racially defined: Africans, whites, coloureds and Asians (Indians and Chinese). What’s with the hysteria?\n\nThose who see their commitment to Africa as being defined by the\nidentity — “Africans” — should refocus their energy towards\nunderstanding and embracing all that is African; closing the racial\ngap and making a concerted effort to not merely tolerate other races\nbut be part of them. That today we still have the majority of whites\nin South Africa who struggle to pronounce African names, never mind\nspeak fluently at least one African language, is a shame. It raises\nquestions about the claimed “Africanness”, commitment to national\nunity and general patriotism. </blockquote>\n\n\nIn responding to Sentletse's second post, Marius Redelinghuys says, <a href=\"http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/mariusredelinghuys/2011/01/11/were-not-all-africans-were-jews/\">\"We’re not all Africans, we’re Jews!\"</a>:\n<blockquote>In his subsequent response it becomes clear that it in\nfact is not a scientific discussion of human biological origins but is\ninstead, as I argued, an empty political argument that used “science”\nas a crutch: “That today we still have the majority of whites in South\nAfrica who struggle to pronounce African names, never mind speak\nfluently at least one African language, is a shame.”\n\nSo it’s really not about human evolution, but rather a political\nstatement about identity. Fine, I thought as much, so please leave\nscience out of it.\n\nBeyond this lack of conceptual clarity there is the issue of cognitive\ndissonance, selective reasoning and even inconsistencies in his\nargument (which makes me wonder who is guilty of an emotional and\nirrational outburst).\n\nThese inconsistencies are rather sad, considering the man on the one\nhand held that white people are of Chinese origin, therefore not black\nand especially not African. In his follow-up he switches from arguing\nfrom science to arguing from legislation (which is not, by the way,\nscientific or dependent on evidence) and informs us that “[t]he Broad\nBased Economic Empowerment Act and the Employment Equity Act is\nunequivocal in its definition of black people, who are ‘Africans,\ncoloureds and Indians’ “.</blockquote>\n",

      "A number of South Africans have responded to Sentletse Diakanyo's post entitled \"We are not all Africans, black people are!\"",
      "We wrote a roundup of his post here.",
      "Marius Redelinghuys, a political science lecturer at Midrand Graduate Institute who calls himself \"Alternative Afrikaner\", blames Wikipedia and Google for Sentletse's Wiki’ed or Googled \"original thought\":\n\n\n\n\n \nI blame Wikipedia and Google which have instilled in some the\narrogance to think their Wiki’ed or Googled “original thought” places\nthem on par with leading academics in their various fields.",
      "Sentletse's post reads like an excerpt from an apartheid-era history textbook:\n \nThe most recent perversion, near-rape, of paleoanthropology,\nevolutionary biology and population genetics is done by none other\nthan our very own Sentletse Diakanyo.",
      "His latest rant entitled “We are\nnot all Africans, black people are!” reads like an excerpt from an\napartheid-era history textbook.",
      "Marius notes that all modern humans have a direct ancestry linked to Africa:\n\n All studies of global mtDNA divergence have shown that\nAfrican populations have the biggest mtDNA divergence (followed by\nAsian and European populations).",
      "The fact that Africans have the\ngreatest mtDNA sequence variations proves they have amassed the most mtDNA mutations, providing compelling evidence for the idea of African origin of humankind because the population with the most diversity is almost certainly the ancestral population and all other population groups seem to be subsets of the diversity found in Africa, further buttressing the argument for an African origin.",
      "He concludes by telling Sentletse that whether he likes it or not, we are all Africans:\n\n \nContinents, countries and race are social constructions, and underneath it all, we’re all humans: humans who came out of Africa.",
      "We\nare all Africans, Mr Diakanyo, whether you like it or not.",
      "Jason van Niekerk, a lecturer in the philosophy department at Wits University, responds to Sentletse's post by discussing the problem with defining the term \"African\": \n\n\n There are a couple of problems here, but the essential one is that his argument rests on what’s called the fallacy of\nequivocation, a sleight-of-word trick that takes a word with multiple\nmeanings, makes a point about one, then substitutes the other, like\nthis: the rich are the enemy of the people.",
      "Cheesecake is rich.",
      "Therefore, cheesecake is the enemy of the people.",
      "In much the same\nway, Diakanyo shows that “African” has at least one accepted meaning, picking out black people, then insists that this should be its only meaning in all contexts.",
      "But, of course, we use the term in many\ncontexts, and collapsing all of them to the racial one wouldn’t work\n(here’s the party-trick reason: African Penguins are black AND white,\nbut African all over).",
      "As many of Diakanyo’s respondents have noted,\nthe sense in which some white people contend that they are African\nseems to pick out some sort of relationship to Africa and Africans,\nrather than an insistence that they be considered black.",
      "Is it enough to use the term \"African\" in a geographic sense?:\n\n \n....note that exactly the same fallacy shows up in the most common\nwhite whine generated in response to Diakanyo’s claim: “I’m South\nAfrican, I was born in Africa, so I’m as African as anyone else born\nhere.”",
      "See the trick?",
      "We can use “African” in a geographic sense, so\nthat must settle the question of whether we’re African in all senses.",
      "That’s the same fallacy Diakanyo used.",
      "He says, \"Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean that white people can’t be African, any more than my being a man necessarily prevents my being a feminist\":\n\n  But however much I subscribe to the radical notion that\nwomen are human beings, however much Steinem and Sontag and Greer I read, being a man insulates me from the impact of women’s experience in a way that being a woman never could.",
      "Now, it may well be that I cannot, as a matter of principle, opt out of a commitment to feminism, even if it’s an option, but I’d be a bit of a whiny git to pretend I can’t see why being a man might make it harder to prove my commitment.",
      "And in the same way, many white South Africans want to claim an\nAfrican identity not because they think they deserve it by default,\nbut because they really do care about Africa and Africans, because\nthey feel proud when this continent outperforms racist expectations,\nand deeply hurt when it seems to embody them.",
      "His conclusion:\n So where does this leave us? White South Africans can’t\ninsist that they are automatically African, because that undermines\nthe value of a hard-won identity.",
      "But when black South Africans deny\nthe possibility of white Africans, they cut off the possibility of a\nnon-racist post-apartheid identity that millions of white people want\n(so badly that they insist they already embody it).",
      "And nobody wins by\ninsisting on what African means, while others who have a stake in that\nidentity disagree, because this identity depends on mutual\nrecognition.",
      "The way out is for South Africans, black and white, to try to work out\nwhat our consensual understanding of “African” really is.",
      "Chris Roper refutes Sentletse's argument that whites want to be classified as African.",
      "He says that white people merely want to identify with the ideological construct that is Africa:\n\n\n This is a lie, of course.",
      "White people, and everyone else\nwho was born on this continent and loves it, for all its many faults,\nhave merely wanted to identify with the general ideological construct\nthat is Africa.",
      "Which means embracing its many contradictions, and\nbeing willing to be part of the ever-evolving understandings of what\n\"Africa\" means in the world.",
      "The term \"African\" has always being ambiguous:\n That's the point of these terms, they're always contested\nby various interest groups seeking to use them for their own ends.",
      "In\nyour case, apparently to antagonise South Africans who are trying to\nachieve some sort of commonality with their fellow citizens, both\nnational and continental, so that they can work together to build a\nviable life.",
      "Don't get me wrong -- I'm also nauseated by people who claim to be\nAfrican when we're hosting a World Cup, but mysteriously become South African when asked to account for kids having their hands lopped off in Rwanda.",
      "It's bad enough being asked to believe in a country, but a continent?",
      "And there's nothing more irritating than some white oke who thinks that the Castle beer ad is \"moving\", and who claims to love African music because he owns a Juluka CD.",
      "His conclusion:Zombie Verwoerd stalks the Internet and the country.",
      "Hendrik Verwoerd was Prime Minister of South Africa from 1958 until his assassination in 1966.",
      "The spirit of Hendrik Verwoerd still haunts this country and the\ninternet, a zombie stumbling around feeding off the grim life force\nthat is intolerance and racism.",
      "Every time we get bitten, or as in the\ncase of this column, take the bait, we create more hate-filled\nzombies.",
      "Ah well, at least when we have all fed off each other's pain,\nwe can then, truly, say \"We are all zombies\".",
      "But we won't be\nhuman.",
      "Sarah Britten, who has unfriended Sentlese on Facebook and blocked him on Twitter, worries about the attention the media gives him.",
      "She says, \"He’s just a blogger and (let’s face it) blogging is not the same as appearing on the opinion page of the Sunday papers\":\n\n\n Yes, it’s important to acknowledge a range of views, and\nit’s important that they be aired so that they can be challenged.",
      "But\nlet’s be honest here: is Sentletse actually worthy of being quoted in\nthe serious media, the Mail &amp; Guardians and 702s of this world?",
      "He’s\nnot an academic or a politician, and there’s no clear platform from\nwhich he speaks.",
      "What exactly is the source of his authority?",
      "I don’t\nsee it.",
      "He’s just a blogger and (let’s face it) blogging is not the\nsame as appearing on the opinion page of the Sunday papers.",
      "All this media coverage is serving less to promote debate and more to\ncreate a potential monster.",
      "Knowing Mo, he is chuckling throatily\nright now, enjoying every minute of it.",
      "Sipho Hlongwane responds with a light touch congratulating \"President Sentletse Diakanyo\" who \"battled a fierce and hostile media, courts, intellectuals and outraged white, Indian and Chinese people\":\n\n\n He even battled against leaders from other countries in\nAfrica in the famous “Most of You Aren’t Really Africans” debate at\nthe 2012 African Union summit and reasserted South Africa’s position\nas African Country Most Full of Shit.",
      "He concludes:\n The convenor of the Friends of Sentletse, Samora Castro\nAfrika (who is now rumoured to have a R9 billion telecommunications\ntender from the government) said they wouldn’t stop at changing the\nConstitution.",
      "“If only black people can be Africans, it naturally\nfollows that only Africans can have any claim to African land.",

      "Long may you continue to define us.",
      "Khaya Dlanga, an award winning blogger, says a white person can be an African:\n\n What does the dictionary define an African as? “Noun:\nAfrican - A native or inhabitant of Africa.”",
      "Since we have established\nthe definition of an African perhaps we should also define what a\nnative is.",
      "“Noun: native - 1.",
      "A person born in a particular place or\ncountry.",
      "2.",
      "An indigenous person who was born in a particular place.”",
      "What do we conclude from this?",
      "If a white person is born in a\nparticular country in Africa, that white person is a native of that\ncountry.",
      "Since they happen to have been born in a country in Africa\nthat means they are African.",
      "He says Sentletse does not define what an African is:\n \nThe writer of the blog doesn’t really define what an African is.",
      "His\nanswer is a simplistic “if you are black you are African”.",
      "There is no\nacknowledgement of the complexities of blackness.",
      "He has not\nconsidered the black people of Papua New Guinea for example.",
      "These\npeople did not really originate from Africa, yet they look as black as\nSentletse and me.",
      "The question then needs to be asked, are people from Papua New Guinea considered African?",
      "Scientists claim that these\npeople have their origins in South East Asia some 70 000 years\nago.",
      "There is no such thing as pure race:\n\n Scientists today claim that there is in fact only one\nrace, the human race.",
      "Separating ourselves by physical appearance has no scientific basis.",
      "In 1943, Ruth Benedict and Gene Wetfish published “Races of Mankind” in which they claim that there is actually no race because most people in the world have in-between-skin colour.",
      "Therefore there is hardly any pure race if one wishes to use race.",
      "Even Africans aren’t pure because of the mixing that has taken place\nover time.",
      "Following online reactions to his post, Sentletse Diakanyo wrote\nanother blog post entitled \"The imagined threat of ‘die swart gevaar’\".",
      "Swart Gevaar (Afrikaans for black threat) was a term used during the days of the Apartheid South African regime to refer to the perceived security threat of the majority black, African population to the white South African government.",
      "He says that he was not surprised to see \"the panic-stricken reaction\" to his post:\n It was actually not surprising to see the panic-stricken\nreaction to the article I wrote that “We are not all Africans, black\npeople are!”",
      "People responded not to the salient features and actual\ncontent of the article but to their own irrational fears of what could\nbe implied and the motivation behind whatever it is they imagined was\nimplied in the article.",
