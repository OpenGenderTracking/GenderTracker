The shutdown has significantly curtailed the information flow through those channels. The four main internet providers are not working at present. Only the stock market continues to have internet. Blackberry services are working sporadically, and most cell phones are down.\n\nInternet activists are also reminding Egyptians that both internet and cell phone services can be used to track users, and that security precautions are vital. EFF activist Eva Galperin, in a Global Voices Advocacy guest post, says:\n it is absolutely critical that Egyptian protesters take precautions  when communicating online. To reiterate, social networking tools have  given activists a powerful voice, which can be heard well beyond Egypt,  but activists should also remember that the Egyptian government could  use these same tools to identify and retaliate against them.\nDespite that, some writers and observers continue to use digital media to get their message out. Activists have found ways around the shutdown.\n\nPeople around the world are focusing on radio, TV and print media. They have also been using landlines to call colleagues, friends, an relatives outside of Egypt, who are then sending messages in their name, or using landlines to connect to outside internet services.\n\nNora Shalaby, for example says:\n I'm tweeting on behalf of my sister from the states! 2 people seen pouring gasoline on cars in downtown cairo today w/police nearby..#jan25\nJan25 Voices, @Jan25voices has set up a new feed specifically to breech the internet block.
