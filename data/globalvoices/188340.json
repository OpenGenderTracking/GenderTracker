On the other hand, other tiny aspects of our lives might prove that we are. It seems to be normal, for instance, to make fun of black people [Ar] in the cinema, and even call a candy \"The Slave's Head\" because of its colour. \n\nJordanian blogger Roba Al-Assi, wrote about the name given to the marshmallow chocolate in that part of the world.\n\n\n \nI know that the word “slave” by no means has the same implications in Arabic as it does in English. Yet, I can’t be less amused by the name of the marshmallow chocolate “Ras ilabed”, literally meaning “the head of the slave”.\n\n\n\nIt seems that the candy producers had the same feeling like Roba. Hussein Wehbe wrote in his blog about Ghandour, one of the candy's producers who decided to rename their product.\n في خطوة تتلاقى مع مواجهة التمييز العنصري المتفشي في لبنان، قامت شركة غندور بتحويل اسم أحد منتوجاتها الّذي يعدّ من الأكثر شعبية “رأس العبد” الى “طربوش غندور”. ف”المشترى” اللّذيذ الّذي يحمل رأساً أسود كان يسمّى رأس العبد بسبب لونه، ما كان يشكّل شكلاً من أشكال العنصريّة حتّى في أبسط الأمور الحياتية في لبنان.\n In a step that fits in the fight against racism in Lebanon, Ghandour decided to rename one of its most popular products, \"Ras El Abed\", or \"Slave's Head\", and call it \"Tarboush Ghandour\", or \"Ghandour's Hat\". The sweet product that looks like a brown or black head, was used to be called slave's head because of its colour, which was considered as a sort of racism even when it comes to a tiny detail of the Lebanese life.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_188519\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"240\" caption=\"Sambo, the new name for Slave Head.

Her husband was a Lebanese from Tripoli. In fact, it's not only her shop that attracted us, but also her entire family, who were beautiful and nice. We loved the shop and its owners, but we never remembered its name, nor the name of anyone from the family that owned it. We used to go there whenever we had enough money from our allowance as children, and every time somebody asked us, \"Where are you going?\", we'd just answer, \"To the slave\". And on our way back carrying a big box filled with things, we'd also tell people, \"This is from the slave\". She used to love us, and even though we were almost 10 years old, she used to call us \"her customers\". At that time I never felt anything wrong in calling her \"the slave\", as I used to call her so in a very respected and loving way. But now, I get ashamed every time I recall how we used to call her.\n\nIt's hard to limit the issue of discrimination to skin colour only in the Arab world. It's normal for almost every region here to make fun of a part of it's own people. In Egypt, people make fun of those coming from upper Egypt, \"Se'ed\". In Lebanon and Syria, the joke is on those coming from \"Homs\". And here is a Moroccan cleric who preached against the celebration of the Yennayer/Amazigh New Year. The cleric didn't just stop at the new year's celebrations, but he also preached against the use of the Berbet/Tamazight language and called the Berber people as traitors working for the advancement of Israel and Zionism [Ar]. Finally, sometime the joking is international, like the case here where a couple of Egyptian movies poke fun at Yemeni or Filipino people. [Ar]",
