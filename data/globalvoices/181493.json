Suleman was one of a list of only 87 individuals globally. In June, this move provoked reactions in Mozambique, as Suleman is a high profile person who owns the biggest and newest shopping center in Maputo.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_181515\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"375\" caption=\"Maputo Shopping Center, Flickr user liam_mac_liam with CC license\"][/caption]\n\nBlogger Carlos Serra remarked at the time [pt] that the case had \"caused a great social commotion and permanent debate in a number of sectors [of society]\". Rapper Azagaia recorded the single \"Arrrri\" about the case (previously mentioned by Global Voices).\n\nSuleman's close connections to the powers in the ruling party were also no secret in Maputo. Meditabundo blog wrote [Pt]\n Confesso que nao fiquei muito espantado, embora nunca tivesse colocado uma ideia semelhante na minha mente.
