  "body": "The Western Province administrative capital, Mongu, on Friday erupted when Lozi tribal loyalists who want to secede from the rest of Zambia fought running battles with police on the day they “declared independence.” Two people were shot dead by the police, a number of people were injured and over 200 arrested and are likely to be charged with treason.\n\nThe Lozi loyalists want the Zambian government to restore the 1964 Barotse Agreement which gave formal recognition of the authority of the Litunga, king of the Lozi whose predecessors signed agreements with explorers and colonial governments. These agreements entitled the kingdom to royalties from minerals mined from faraway Copperbelt Province.\n\nLozi loyalists started clamouring for the restoration of the agreement around 1992, just after the defeat of Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia’s first president who signed the agreement a few months before independence with the reigning Litunga at the time and the British government, the departing colonial authority. Ironically, Kaunda is the one who ignored, constitutionally or otherwise, the provisions of the agreement. He also ran an oppressive one party government which did not tolerate dissent like is arising from the people now calling for the agreement’s restoration.\n\nA few months after the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) under President Frederick Chiluba took over, Lozi loyalists from all walks of life, from within and without the country, including those holding positions in the new government, gathered in Lusaka to discuss the Barotse Agreement.\n\nMost Zambians who had been young or not born at independence heard of the Barotse Agreement for the first time after the Lusaka gathering. The momentum was, however, somehow lost especially after other ethnic groups in the province, notably the Nkoya, indicated that they were not part of the Barotse Agreement. They called for the establishment of a tenth province they wanted called Kafue Province if the agreement was restored.\n\nWith the current unfolding events in Western Province, government has recently shut down Radio Lyambai for allegedly broadcasting inflammatory statements inciting violence and promoting the so-called independence of Barotseland. It has also banned radio stations from airing phone-in programmes discussing the Barotse Agreement. The minister of home affairs also said government would not  negotiate with “anarchists” on the issue. \n\nThis time around, bloggers have waded into the debate giving their views on the unfolding events in Mongu.\n\nSity Mwitu, writing on the Zambian Watchdog website in an article entitled \"Tracing the Lozi Hatred in Zambia\" says:\n\n\n\n The debate on the restoration of the Barotseland Agreement of 1964 has exposed the hatrage that exists against the Lozis not only from Bembas, but also from Nyanjas. The hatrage for the Lozis has not just started now; but it is a long story that began immediately when Zambia attained her independence. The basis for this hatrage originated from the fact that at the time Zambia became independent in 1964 many Lozis were more educated than Bembas and Nyanjas. Of course, it may have been natural considering the fact that education first began in Barotseland at Sefula mission in March, 1887.\n\nThat is why Dr. Kaunda’s first Cabinet had seven (7) elite Lozis of profound standing; of which six (6) were University graduates. As a result, evil schemes were put in place to deprive the Lozis of their dignity and cultural pride. Therefore, it should not surprise to anyone to hear of PF leader Mr. Michael Sata’s recommendation to the former President Dr. FTJ Chiluba regarding their stance on the Barotseland Agreement and his suggestion to the then President to drop the recognition of the Litunga in 1996. How can someone drop the recognition of state that was founded in 1550? The hatrage for the Lozis is rife in every sphere of life in Zambia and now it has even turned into a terminally illness without cure, hence the justifiable call of the Patriots for secession. For the past 46 years, Lozis have been intimated, suppressed and oppressed, so Lozis are terribly hurt. If you talked to any Lozi hailing from Barotseland from all the walks of life except those whose stomachs are fed by the MMD oppressive regime, they will confess that they are genuinely hurt. Lozis are not seeking attention, but respect and equity in every sphere of life.\n\nThe first Republic President Dr. Kenneth Kaunda knows this too well and that is why this issue is now haunting him since most of his colleagues who penned their signatures on the document have since passed on. What this means is that Dr. Kaunda is the solution on this matter and his availability should not being ignored completely. He must not continue to be silent on this matter.
