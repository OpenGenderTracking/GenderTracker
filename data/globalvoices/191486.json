Les pays arabes – et plus particulièrement les monarchies du Golfe et d’Arabie – ont tremblé à l’aube de la révolution nassérienne, face au risque de voir l’Égypte devenir le pays le plus puissant de la région, s’appuyant sur une politique Panarabe, pour l’unité des pays arabes. Si le pouvoir égyptien saute, qu’un successeur reprenne le flambeau d’un pays destiné en fin de compte, par son importance géopolitique et démographique à être un pays majeur de la région.\n\nEnglish:\n\nMubarak is equally no Gamal Abdel Nasser. The Arab states - and in particular the monarchies of the Gulf and Arabia - that trembled at the dawn of the Nasserite Revolution, risk seeing Egypt becoming the most powerful state in the region, following pan-Arab policies, for the unity of Arab states. If Egyptian power leaps, that a successor retakes the torch of a country destined, by its geopolitical and demographic importance, to be a major country in the region.\nGreen Resistance points to wonders of people power in changing the paradigm in the region:\n Just a few weeks ago, I heard the same comments I’d be hearing for years: we the Arabs need a dictatorship.
