Dozens of Romanians are trapped in an offshore oil rig in Libya, but in order to return they need visa from the Libyan government. According to the Romanian top-diplomat, Teodor Baconschi, discussions between Bucharest and Tripoli are under way in order to convince the local authorities to allow their return home. The Ministry recommended all Romanian citizens in Libya to leave the country by any legal means that are still available. The Government decided this week to pay the costs of transportation for the Romanians willing to return in the country. The 220 Romanians who already requested this support, according to the Ministry, will be returned via Malta. The biggest problem is regarding the situation of those living more than 1,000 kilometers away from Tripoli for whom it will not be possible to offer the secure transportation. \nIn its turn, oil group Rompetrol announced Monday that it set up its own task group in charge with “monitoring and maintaining the contact with the 62 employees dispatched to Libya by the Drilling and Special Well Services of Rompetrol SA.” “At the same time, we are in contact with the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and of the Romanian Consulate of Tripoli, in order to be correctly informed about the situation of the Romanian personnel from the affected areas, and to identify the fastest and safest solutions to protect them,” the Communication and Public Relations Department of Rompetrol Group announced, quoted by the local media.\nTwo weeks ago, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended the Romanian citizens in Libya, especially those who are in the north-eastern region (Cyrenaica) to get in touch with the Romanian Embassy in Tripoli, so they can be recorded into the database kept by the diplomatic mission. Romanian citizens are also warned that sporadic interruptions might affect telecommunication lines across the whole Libyan territory. They are advised to stay away from crowded areas, especially from protest rallies, and to strictly observe traffic interdictions. This includes the family members and the staff of companies operating on the territory of this state. The affected Romanians may get in touch with the Consular Department between 10.00 AM and 22.00 PM, at the phone number +40.21.319.21.37 and at the e-mail address drco@mae.ro.\nLibya hosts a significant Romanian community, mostly formed of oil and construction workers.
