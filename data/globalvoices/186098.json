I WAS SHOCKED…..\n\nI remember…\nI  screamed in the house and my aunt run out to check on me, after i told her the tragedy i don’t remember exactly the order of the things that happened but i remember trying to call my parents in Haiti with no answer and i know we turn on the tv  and  i am sure that’s where i saw Carel broadcasting about what happened with tears in his eyes, listening to his desperate voice was painful… \n\nI remember…\n2 weeks ago , i went home to see what was left of my hometown but also for the holidays that weren’t holy nor happy. With the few Ms earthquake left for Haiti, we Haitians couldn’t celebrate. What i saw in my brothers eyes while i was going through Port-au-Prince was a mixture of despair, fear, suffering ,  misery, pain, hate, indifference but mostly the waiting of better days to come….  A year after there is still a lot of rubble, people are still living under tents in these refugees/victims camps, people are still steeling,women are still being raped, violence is not stopping and cholera is still making victims…. maybe its because i am an outsider that i didn’t realise any changes were made , but if i am comparing to the pictures i have received a year ago ta what i saw, besides the dead bodies and a few rubbles removed , the rest is the same……THE BIG WORK HASN’T BEEN DONE….\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_139958\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\" caption=\"National Palace, by caribbeanfreephoto, used under a Creative Commons Licence.\"][/caption]\n\nOn Twitter, the hashtags for the one-year anniversary of the earthquake are #remember #Haiti - and Tweeple have been using the micro-blogging platform to do just that:\n\n\n @SophieChavanel: People gathered in front of National Palace #haiti #remember http://yfrog.com/gzzfjmj\n\n@SophieChavanel: People are gathering everywhere in PAP to commemorate this sad anniversary #haiti #remember http://yfrog.com/h5asqevj\n\n@JAMGAL2010: #1yr ago today.... a horrible tragedy shook the lives of the people of #Haiti #remember http://bit.ly/bvYqP8\n\n@chadcat: to all those that lost their lives, to all those that were affected and still are, and to all those that helped #remember #Haiti\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_139958\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\" caption=\"Pétion-ville cemetery, by caribbeanfreephoto, used under a Creative Commons Licence.\"][/caption]\n\nBloggers on the ground in Haiti continue to weigh in.
