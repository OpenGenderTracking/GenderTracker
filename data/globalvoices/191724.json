  "body": "Jordan has seen several weeks of peaceful protests asking for a change in government led by Prime Minister Samir Rifai.  These protests were aimed at relief from high prices which are increasing due to decreased government subsidies and increased taxes.  Given Jordan's high public debt, running at 62.4% of GDP, Rifai's job was largely seen as decreasing public debt.   His connections with business as the leader of Jordan Dubai Capital led to ire and accusations that he was more interested in corporations than public good.  \n\nRifai is being replaced with Maarouf Bakhit, a former Prime Minister from 2005 to 2007, who has roots in the Jordanian military and as Jordan's ambassador to Israel.   Upon the announcement of the personnel change, Twitter lit up with Jordanian reactions.  Some expressed their appreciation for PM Rifai's service to Jordan.
