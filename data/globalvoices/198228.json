The protesters say that the use of force, for such peaceful protests was excessive, while the government stands its ground that it was proportionate.\n\nWhile the protesters demands seemed to focus on political and economic reforms within a constitutional monarchy, the twist in events and the death of six protesters over the past few days, has drastically changed the demands, with some voices are even calling for the end of the rule of Al Khalifas, who have been in power since 1783.\n\nPolitical parties, in dialogue with the government now, however, insist that is not the goal of the protests, and are willing to negotiate a solution, which calls for more political reforms within a constitutional monarchy.\n\nOne victim fell on the first day, followed by another killed by police during the funeral of the first.\n\nFollowing more confrontation with the police, the marchers occupied Pearl Roundabout, referred to as Lulu or Pearl Square by international journalists here.\n\nOn February 17, at 3am, frantic tweets came from Lulu, which was attacked by police, and some say the army. The tragic events that unfolded that night horrified some Bahrainis, while others, including some in the government denied it even happened. Four men lost their lives in the pre-dawn attack, which stunned Bahrain, leaving an unconfirmed number of injuries and many people missing - and still unaccounted for (update: Missing people found).\n\nThe Crown Prince Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa then appeared on state television, ordering the end to bloodshed, and the opening of national dialogue, in which all Bahrainis will be party of.\n\nMeanwhile, some Bahraini officials continue to provoke the feelings of Bahrainis who witnessed bloodshed in their country, by totally denying the sad escalations and tragic turn of events.
