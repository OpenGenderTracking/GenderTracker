It's based on the trust in the community whose traditions have shaped the way we live and the institutions that organize our life activities. Given this, we can talk about economic patriotism, but here we see some difficulty. In Poland, the tradition of being wealthy is rather weak and, above all, dramatically discontinuous. So, the Polish patriotism, evaluated from the economic perspective, needs more modernizing characteristics and is associated with loyalty to our nation as a project. A great project - Poland!
