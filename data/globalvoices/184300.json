Here's our latest roundup of blog posts about the referendum.\n\n116,000 Southern Sudanese have left Northern Sudan since last October, Maggie Fick reports:\n 116,000 (and counting*) Southern Sudanese people have left northern Sudan since late October. With only one week left before polling for the southern referendum starts, people are arriving en masse in southern state capitals at a pace that is quite clearly quickening.\n[caption id=\"attachment_184353\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"213\" caption=\"Women and children gather water at a transit camp for newly arrived returnees in Aweil.

Because they have reason to fear if their rights will be respected in northern Sudan following the referendum.\nMagdi El Gizouli analyses President Omar Bashir's address to the nation during the 55th independence anniversary. He says, \"Allowing the South to choose its own destiny in Bashir’s formulation constitutes “the last line in the nation’s book of healing”:\n From this platform Bashir addressed the three issues of the day, the impending partition of the South, the conflict in Darfur, and the opposition’s demand for a political re-configuration in Khartoum on secession of the South. Regarding the South Bashir presented the choice between peaceful secession and war-ridden unity as the brave and democratic remedy to the chronic fissure in the organic whole. Allowing the South to choose its own destiny in Bashir’s formulation constitutes “the last line in the nation’s book of healing”, since peace, the ultimate target of his rule, is surely the truest embodiment of the country’s independence.\nAccording to Yobu Annet, the disputed Abyei region may face serious commodity shortages if the South secedes because most of the goods come from the North:\n The business community in Abyei is very concerned - many think that secession may bring a economic downturn in the area. “If Abyei is annexed to the South then border trade may be affected”, said Chol Mayen, a businessman. “If it happens that the border is completely closed, we can still go to East Africa for goods.”\nThe referendum is a cause for anxiety for foreign traders in Juba:\n For Birungi Mary, a Ugandan trader who deals with vegetables in a Juba market, the referendum is cause for anxiety. “We are preparing to leave, and then come back after the referendum if there is no violence.”\n\nMary is one of thousands of traders in Juba, many of them from neighbouring countries, who are apprehensive about what the referendum will bring. Already suffering from rising prices on imported goods, many fear that referendum-related violence could disrupt business, and valuable goods could be destroyed.\nIn Konyokonyo and Jebel Markets in Juba, many foreign traders said they are going home for Christmas, and then wait till the referendum exercise is completed before returning.\nSouth Sudan Info has created a timeline of Sudan headlines in 2010:\n In 9 days, southern Sudanese are heading to the polls in a self-determination referendem to decide whether or not to establish Africa’s newest independent country.
