For the past 12 days, they have remained on the square, eating, drinking, chanting, cheering - simply living there day and night. Life here has its own rhythm now, and the spirit on diplay is of a mini Utopia.\n\nMornings begin with physical exercises while chanting \"Down down Mubarak!\".\n\n\n\nAs the day continues, and more people pour into the square, residents welcome them with more chants as @ashoukry says:\n\n أجمل لحظات اليوم:استقبال الثوار بالغناء و التصفيق عند دخول التحرير، لحظات لا تنسي و نسائم حرية حقيقية تتهادي و تتدفق فاذهبوا و أروا قلوبكم\n The best time of the day: Welcoming the rebels into Tahrir Sq. with singing and clapping. Unforgettable moments where we breathe the air of freedom.\n\nThe million pound question on everyone's mind, was asked by @Maysaloon from Syria on Twitter:\n\n Had a thought today, what are all those people in Tahrir Square doing for sanitation? I don't see any cubicles anywhere...\n\nAnd so I replied:\n\n Either they use nearby mosques' or underground public toilets, or nearby buildings, or shops. Some even return home &amp; come back.\n\nFor instance @TAFATEFO tweeted while staying on Tahrir Square himself:\n واحد قال في الميك انه ممثل أصحاب الـ 3 عمارات اللي في الميدان .. وانهم فاتحين الدورين السادس والسابع للي عايزين ياخدوا دش أو يناموا\n Someone said on the loudspeakers that he is a representative from the 3 buildings on the square. They said they opened their 6th and 7th floors to anyone wants to take a shower or sleep.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_193583\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\" caption=\"People spend a good while of their day cleaning the square.
