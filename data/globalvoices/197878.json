I haven’t run across any new reports of protests, unrest, or violent incidents. The Daily Monitor reports that as of about 9pm last night, “Kampala City Centre is deserted in the early evening hours as both military police and army deployed heavily soon after elections closed. All the major roads in the centre… are all under close surveillance with foot and mobile military patrols.” (See yesterday’s blogs below for details about the violence, which the New York Times dubbed, “sporatic flare-ups”.)\n\nUgandans will be discussing for weeks (months) the confusion at the polling places yesterday. Journalist Gloria Laker writes, “I am not happy and very disappointed with the Electoral Commission, not sure of the new name they should be given. Is it, “Electoral Confusion”? Many people could not vote because of missing names, displacement and misplacement of pictures etc and my disappointment is that even now, the EC Chairman has not come out to apologize and explain. This is total confusion from EC. What exactly went wrong with the voter register, is that a smart way of rigging? Not fair for citizens to fail to exercise his voting rights.”\n\n\nEvelyn says that for the first time she went to the polls and did what was right for the country: \n\n\n\n This time, 2011, saw our family divided! My brother who from the beginning always thought differently from the rest of us, did not change his mind. My family was divided with the presidential vote. I had a different perspective of who I thought would lead this nation best, my elder brother felt differently too, and my 2 younger brothers, were still under the wings of mummy.. and trust me she is good with convincing so she had those two do as she said.\nThe final results are not yet in... but one thing is for sure, the winner is already seen. Whether these will be the best 5 years Uganda has seen or the worst, I have no idea, all I know is that for the first time, I headed to the polls and did what I believed was right for me and the future of Uganda, whether what I thought was right will win or lose, I will live with that.\n\n\n\n\nOn Twitter, where the hashtag #ugandavotes is used, @UgInsomniac says: \n\n Good job EC tally center!
