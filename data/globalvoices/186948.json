However, it is beyond normal people's imagination that the propaganda machine would turn its resentment into the censorship of the terms \"award\" and \"prize\".\n\nAccording to the latest general notice from the Central Propaganda Bureau regarding news and propaganda in 2011, all news and commercial websites should not initiate any kind of nation-wide selection (listings and awards) of news, people or events. The background of this notice is related to a series of events last year:\n\nFirstly, Chinese political dissident Liu Xiaobo won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nSecondly, the Time Weekly announced a list of \"100 Most Influential People of Our Time\", which included food safety activist Zhao Lianhai and several signers of the Charter 08, including Cui Weiping and Xu Youyu. Peng Xiaoyun, who was in charge of the list, was forced to take a leave from the magazine.\n\nApart from the above two controversial events, there were numerous listings and awards organized by media organizations last December to serve as the 2010 year end roundup.  For example, on 17 December 2010, the Southern Metropolis Daily issued 23 awards to artists, citizens, business leaders, designers, youths and etc.\n\nTo stop media organizations from promoting \"illegitimate\" and \"un-orthodox\" achievements and practices in the civil society, the government banned Southern Weekend's listing of best news report, \"Salute to the Media 2010\", last month. Moreover, the Central Propaganda Bureau recently also decides that governmental and party authorities should have a monopoly position to issue \"awards\" and \"prizes\".\n\nIn the actual implementation of the general notice, the Chinese character \"獎\", meaning \"award\" or \"prize\", is banned in major media outlets and public events without approvals by the relevant authorities.\n\nTo challenge the absurd censorship measure, independent media worker Wang Xiaoshan launched a \"2010 Wang Xiaoshan News Award\" via his blog. There are in total 6 awards and the results were announced on 12  January 2011 via Twitter.\n 【1】大铁锤奖，获奖者：南方都市报记者：龙志。获奖报道：《安元鼎：北京截访“黑监狱”调查》，http://gcontent.oeeee.com/f/6c/f6c9dc70ecfd8f90/Blog/4a3/c0aee0.html 。\n 1.
