Gaddafi's son, Seif al-Islam, paints a different picture. He says the revolution is minor, and that troops loyal to the regime are regaining control of the country. The Gaddafi's insist they plan to live-and-die in Libya. \n\nWhile the future is still unclear, below are testimonies from Libyans, who continue their lives in the face of police and military violence that has already claimed the lives of hundreds.\n\nVoices from the ground\n\nFeb17Voices is an online initiative to record phone calls from Libyans and transcribe, translate, and share them on the web. The people behind the project are also responsible for Jan25Voices, a similar project at the height of Egypt's recent protests. One caller explains that most stores are closed in Tripoli, Libya's capital.\n \n \nThe situation in Tripoli is very, very tumultuous. Out of 100 stores, maybe four are opened. Even the stores open are not at ease. If there are 10 entrances, maybe one is open. \n\nHere is a video from Tripoli uploaded by  Ali Tweel, that shows people waiting for bread in Tripoli's Jraba Street.\n\n\n\nListen!\n\nAl Jazeera reported that many Libyans have been going missing, often kidnapped in front of their houses. A female caller from Tripoli speaks about trying to protect her family. Here is part of the transcript provided by Alive In Libya: \n\n We are afraid, we are afraid because you know we are women, I have daughters here. Every house is armed only by knives. We have nothing else, but we have God. We believe in God, God’s here with us. We are not afraid of death. \n\nListen!\n\nThis woman in Tripoli speaks about the thoughts and motivations of the protesters: \"OK, kill us. We do or we'll be free. The only thing we want is our freedom.\"\n\nListen!\n\nFrom the Libyan Youth Movement's page on Facebook, here are some notes regarding a phone call between a Libyan living in the UK and his brother who remains in Libya. \n\n \nThe confirmed minimum death toll in Benghazi is 800+ alone and national is 2,000 + considering those figures there are many unaccounted for missing, and the solders who refused to fight were cremated and many are also unaccounted for, so the death toll could easily be double. there has been massacres in Zawiya and other cities in the west. One of our neighbours have been missing for 3 days then found in a fridge of the hospital who was unaccounted for.  \n\nAlso on Alive in Libya is a translated conversation with a radio reporter from Benghazi, who disagrees with the government's official line that all is well in Libya. \n\n\n\n \nAnother point I would like to make on Sayf al Islam’s comment when he said that there is no revolution in Libya and everything is fine except a few cities in the hand of terrorists. These are not terrorists Mr Ghaddafi, these are honourable and free people, and they have stood up to the collaborators you sent because you yourself are a collaborator. If you were an honourable man you would not have done what you have. \n\nIn Zawiya, a town 30 miles west of Tripoli (Gaddafi's main stronghold) international media reported the opposition have taken control. On Twitter, here are a few of the messages that appeared on Sunday.\n\n @jrug: Zawiya locals say anti aircraft guns used against people &amp; shooting from minaret. Rebel flag flying over main Sq, Gaddafi picture gone\n\n\n @jrug: With a tank which has defected. Large crowd shouting down down with the regime - Zawiya\n\n\n @EnoughGaddafi: Red crescent says cleared to get all the way to Zawiya but that security situation has changed, it is unsafe 2 travl towards #tripoli #feb17\n\n\nThis post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011.",
