With trouble brewing at home and Libyans taking to the Internet to vent off, could Gaddafi be foreseeing his doom as a \"victim of Facebook and YouTube\"?\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_187551\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"119\" caption=\"Muammar Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi, photo from Wikimedia Commons by Jim Gordon (CC-BY 2.0)\"][/caption]\n\nIn a televised address, he regretted the end of Ben Ali's 23-year rule, saying that he had hoped the Tunisian dictator would continue to run Tunisia \"for life.\"\n\nGaddafi, who has headed Libya since 1970, also brushed off cyber-activism as \"lies\" fabricated by drunkards and netizens high on drugs, describing the Internet as a \"vacuum cleaner,\" that had the capacity suck everything.\n\nThe Internet, he added, was a tool created by \"them\" - to ridicule \"us.\"\n\nIn his address he said:\n حتى أنتم إخواني التوانسة ، ربما أنكم تقرؤون في الكلينكس هذا ، والكلام الفارغ في الإنترنت . وهذا الإنترنت ، الذي أي واحد أهبل ؛ يسكر ويحط فيه أي كلام ، هل تصدقه !. الإنترنت هذا مثل الكناسة التي ترمي فيها أي حاجة ، فأي واحد تافه ؛ أي واحد كذاب ؛ أي واحد سكران ؛ أي واحد مخمور ؛ واحد شارب الأفيون ؛ يقدر يقول أي كلام في الإنترنت ، وأنتم تقرؤونه وتصدقونه .. هذا كلام بدون فلوس.. هل نصبح نحن ضحية لـ «فيسبوك» وضحية «الكلينكس « وضحية «يوتيوب»!، نصبح ضحية الأدوات التي صنعوها هم لكي يضحكوا بأمزجتنا !..\n Even you, my Tunisian brothers. You may be reading this Kleenex and empty talk on the Internet.\nThis Internet, which any demented person, any drunk can get drunk and write in, do you believe it? The Internet is like a vacuum cleaner, it can suck anything. Any useless person; any liar; any drunkard; anyone under the influence; anyone high on drugs; can talk on the Internet, and you read what he writes and you believe it. This is talk which is for free. Shall we become the victims of \"Facebook\" and \"Kleenex\"* and \"YouTube\"! Shall we become victims to tools they created so that they can laugh at our moods?\n *Kleenex is Gaddafi's reference to Wikileaks\nWriting from Boston, Jillian C York notes:\n So, while Qaddafi may not be taken seriously, any overtures he makes toward the Internet’s dangers could be well-taken by regional leaders. As we’ve seen with Tunisia (and Iran), this matters…and it doesn’t. Tunisians were operating under a strictly censored Internet, and yet still managed to disseminate information across a variety of social networks. On the other hand, any stakes a government can drive through its net-enabled civil society, it will.\nShe continues:\n Qaddafi sees Tunisian Internet usage during the uprising as an American conspiracy (which I would state very strongly, it is not – such a suggestion is offensive to the large and longstanding Tunisian blogging and social media community).\nOn Twitter, the mood is that Gaddafi spoke out of turn, catapulting Libya to the forefront of online discussions, especially since Libyan netizens are starting to vent off about troubles of their own online - using the very same tools their leader predicted would make victims out of them.\n\nLibyan Ghazi Gheblawi observes:\n Speaking to many Libyan intellectuals, activists and bloggers, all are upset of #Gaddafi 's speech about #Tunisia , most r disgusted\nLibyana Americana notes:\n #Gaddafi is so sad about \"Zine\" being gone...he misses his friend...\nEgyptian columnist Mona Eltahawy weighs in:\n Gotta hand it to #Gaddafi though - no other #Arab dictator is mad enough to give a speech about #Tunisia revolution.\nAnd she adds:\n \n \n #BenAli told #US that #Gaddafi \"not a normal person”, which explains why Gaddafi told #Tunisians in speech Saturday that BenAli best leader.\n\n \nTunisian Haykel Azak reminds us:\n It's always a pleasure listening to #Gaddafi speak because you never know what shit will come flying out of that mouth http://bit.ly/huSYxm\nAnd Kuwait-based Aya Kabbara asks:\n @CNN are the rumors true?

He is an actual JOKE.\nFrom the UAE, Mishaal Al Gergawi observes:\n Looks like that Gaddafi speech wasn't that effective after all.\nAnd Jordanian Tololy concludes:\n Ah so it WAS Gaddafi who inadvertently sparked the protests in #Libya through a speech! http://tinyurl.com/4devwv3 (Arabic) #Irony\n\nMeanwhile, information is seeping slowly out of Libya about unrest. Just like it was in neighbouring Tunisia, the war is on on the Internet in Libya, with news of websites being hacked.\n\nOn Al Bab, Brian Whitaker remarks:\n Just two days after the overthrow of President Ben Ali in Tunisia, videos are circulating of disturbances in neighbouring Libya. Needless to say, this is causing a good deal of excitement on Twitter.\nHe continues:\n Almanara, a Libyan opposition website which appears to have Islamist leanings, has posted          three videos of protesters in the city of al-Bayda. There are also a few          more on YouTube          and al-Jazeera has a          report in Arabic.\nThe facts are still rather unclear, but  Almanara says the demonstrators clashed with security forces, threw  stones at a government building and set fire to one of its offices. The  protesters were demanding          \"decent housing and dignified life\", according to the website. Provision of housing appears to be the main issue and there are reports of people taking over apartments and squatting in them.\nToday, Whitaker brings us more news. He writes:\n Yesterday,  I noted that a Libyan opposition website, Almanara, had posted videos showing disturbances in          Libya during the last few days. After that, something odd happened: the website disappeared. Trying to access          Almanara this morning, I simply got an error          message.\nConceivably this could be just a technical glitch, but I suspect not. A          YouTube video of the protests, which I linked to at the same time, has also  disappeared and there are claims on Twitter that access to social  networking websites inside Libya is being blocked.          Another Libyan website, Libya Almostakbal, reports that it has been attacked twice since Friday.\nSeveral copies of the videos, which I  didn't link to yesterday, are still available on the internet. I won't  provide links to them all, but here is          one of them – just to see what happens to it.\nThe protests themselves have not been  reported in the official Libyan media, apart from a statement from the  Revolutionary Committee condemning them.\nMeanwhile, the cause of the trouble is  becoming clearer. It's about delays in providing subsidised housing, and since Thursday activists in several towns have taken over hundreds of  empty properties.\nThis post is part of our special coverage of Libya Uprising 2011.",
