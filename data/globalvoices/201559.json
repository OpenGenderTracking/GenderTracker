[…]\nUser Bnorris wrote [RUS]:\n I would say that in developed countries [social equality] is present even more, as strange as it may seem. I mean, if a person is very successful in Ukraine and feels above others, there he may feel that his position has gone down :) But if the person has been an average programmer without extraordinary demands, he will stay the same even after moving. […]\nUser Victor R. wrote [RUS]:\n I’ve been living in the USA for five years. I have encountered the police several times, but every time everything went in a very polite and neat manner. At the local passport control I’ve been asked how the flight was and what the weather was like in Ukraine. Nobody has ever pointed out my imperfect English, to say the least. […] During the five years, I’ve practically never been put in a situation that would make me feel as a second-rate person. And I must note that most of that time I’ve spent on a work visa (not as a citizen or a resident, just a temporary worker).\nWhy have you decided that it would be better for you THERE?\n\nUser mxc wrote [RUS]:\n …if you are an entrepreneur [who has had enough] of the Ukrainian tax system, you may throw a dart on the world map with your eyes [shut].

It’s a questionable loss, since usually you had to pay for something that someone had [a duty] to do anyway [...]. In Sweden, I cannot “solve [problems].” I mean, [problems] would be solved as much as they have to. As a rule, not less and not more than that.

This is, of course, not a personal presence, but with frequent communication you stop feeling it. Same with friends.\n\n5. I’ve lost the theoretical possibility of “haltura” [moonlighting], which for many of my fellow countrymen has been a very practical one. While owning a company I did not need to [do work on the side], my employees have been doing it and I used to close my eyes on it. Because, seven years before, I had been just like them […]. In Sweden, [it is] difficult. Possible, but very difficult. And one wouldn’t be able to save up a decent amount of money. Because here the system is transparent.

Truly free medical services in all cases of serious illness, excluding dental problems […]. To social security I add a well-secured retirement. I don’t really worry that when I'm old, I'd have to count small change from my pension money, trying to decide whether to buy buckwheat or bread, because if I buy both things I might not have enough to live till the end of the month. […]\n\nI have gained a guarantee that laws would be followed by both citizens and the authorities. […]\n\nFor me the phrase “I pay taxes and therefore have a right” has finally gained its meaning.
