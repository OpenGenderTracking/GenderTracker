She has also used Facebook to announce policies in the past.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_201355\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"180\" caption=\"Zambia's Education Minister, Dora Siliya.

These classes are also run as fundraising units for the schools which charge the pupils nominal fees for administrative purposes such as paying teachers' allowances and buying requisites not provided for by government.\n\nSuch classes are viewed with a lot of stigma because the pupils are viewed as not being too intelligent and derogatorily referred to as “solar” because they are conducted in the afternoons. But the biggest problem is the lack of support from government. Individual school administrations take it upon themselves to enter the pupils for examinations for which they pay for.\n\nSiliya wrote on her wall: \n\n\n We have transformed apu [Academic Production Unit] to open classes so that same fees and teaching offered to all children and give confidence to many parents since apu we viewed as demeaning since it was for kinds that had certificate but didn't make cutoff point. We believe access must be increased for normal lessons for all children with certificate and above [sic]\n\n\nShe added: \n\n\n There will be teething problems as apu turns to open classes but will continue to build more schools by 2015 and also deal with teachers allowances since there will still be double sessions in most high school. Important point is we need to provide education equitably in our schools not encourage disparities.\n\n\nShe continued: \n\n\n Our aim is to ensure all children have access to education by 2015. This means we have to also provide education equitably meaning apu classes seen as demeaning and for those who failed the cut point but got a certificate had to be transformed to open classes where teaching and fees are same with morning classes.\n\n\nZambian citizens on Facebook responded: \n\nEmmanuel Mengo said that the government should have collected public views on issue: \n\n\n\n madam. I commend u for the work done so far. But dont you think u are in a hurry to change things before u consult widely. Early 2009 u said any child who makes a full certificate automatically makes it to grade 10.

What is on the ground is that there are no enough spaces for all pupils with certificates. U are doing a great job but surelly u are in a hurry to make pronouncements. U ve built a good number of schools in the rural but i believe we need more to be built in towns also in order to cater for the large population.

If pupils fail let them repeat that grade so we can avoid having half baked pupils. Abolishing APU was a good idea but placing the very same pupils in classes that have hard working pupils will jst decrease the chances of the hard working pupils getin the attention from their teachers due to too many pupils in 1 class thereby lowering the standards of the education system in the country.\n\n\n\nCharles Forster argued that education and politics should not be mixed: \n\n\n\n Education shud be left out of politics.We teachers &amp; the union ve advisd the journalist Dora nt to phase out APU classes.Pupils &amp; parents are busy scouting 4 places instead of being in class!\n\n\n\nMoses Katongo Chisanga said: \n\n\n\n if you get inside of this issue you will discover that apu is still there exept that they will be paying the same and less fees as the main stream. classes are done in afternon. so where is your argument that the idea will over crowd the cl...asses. if today the teacher ratio is 1 to 70. i dont see this change much. because just like apu the other pupils wil be having classes in afternum. grz should just do more to construct more high skus and greatly improve the condition of services for teachers.
