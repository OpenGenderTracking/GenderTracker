Jhala Nath Khanal, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist and Leninist), was sworn in on Sunday, at a ceremony in capital Kathmandu. Although not known for his charisma or leadership ability, Mr. Khanal has certainly raised hopes for many who viewed chaos and confusion of past seven months as a serious impediment to Nepal's fragile peace process. \n\n[caption id=\"attachment_194079\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"263\" caption=\"Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal taking oath of office.
