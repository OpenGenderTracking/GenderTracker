For most of our English-speaking colleagues, and those in the Climate Action Network (whose mechanism I am now mastering),  the majority of the releases were prepared well before the end of the COP.\n .... whatever the final Cancun agreement is, the President ended her speech with such a phrase: \"We understand that we are not following our own internal regulations but to save face at Cancun, we are adopting the text.\"\nThe blog opapilles.hautetfort.com thinks that\n The agreement nevertheless failed on the critical point: deep and binding cuts in CO2 emissions for developed countries.

CO2 emissions have increased 37% since 1990, and temperatures could climb by 4 to 6 °C by the end of the century.\nSerge Orru, on the site WWWF.fr, asserts in his article, \"Il faut préparer l'après Cancun\" (We Must Prepare for Post-Cancun):\n Yes, progress was made in Cancun that must be given form...but, it is in our industrialized nations that we must massively reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, weapons of mass destruction of mankind! ….\n It's like a Christmas present for our children, but Santa Claus doesn't exist (shhh, just don't tell our little darlings)\n or rather, he must truly exist in each of us, in our actions and in our deeds, every day!\nJean-Michel Bélouve wrote an article on his blog reprinted by the site agora.fr called \"Conférence climatique de Cancun: l'accord cache le désaccord\" (Cancun Climate Conference: The Disagreement Behind the Agreement):\n We may ask ourselves how the countries that we still call wealthy can agree to pay out such sums ($100 billion, by 2020). The agreement also fails to mention the sources of the financing. But we fully realize that the countries of the West, with excess debt and some of them headed for bankruptcy, will not be able to consent to such a demand on public funds. So, during the workshops, they planned new taxes…\n The cost of collecting, monitoring, and policing such a system would be very high, and its effectiveness would be uncertain.\n\nJean-Michel continues, saying that they simply make references to innovative taxes, and adds:\n In short, they don't know where to find the money, because none of the developed countries at the negotiating table appear ready to reach for their wallets.\nThe article also mentions another point in the agreement that appears difficult to implement. The large emerging countries (China, India, Brazil, etc.) are asked to report their inventories of greenhouse gas emissions, and the actions taken to reduce them. The article draws certain conclusions about this request:\n\nThese reports will be submitted for international review, which is to be \"nonintrusive,\" \"nonpunitive,\" and \"respectful of national sovereignty.\" To put it plainly, there will be no monitoring, simply a statement from the countries concerned.\n\nPierre-Jean wrote an article in his blog  neitherdoi.wordpress.com on December 14 called \"Cancun : la Bolivie persiste et ne signe pas,\" (Cancun: Bolivia Still Won't Sign):\n Pablo Solon, negotiator for Bolivia, said, \"this agreement won't stop temperature from rising by 4°C.\" A Green Fund managed by the World Bank, no word on how the money will be collected, no specific commitments to lower emissions, recognition of REDD mechanism  (Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) as is, in other words, without considering indigenous populations or recognizing market mechanisms, etc. Seen from this perspective, we reach the conclusion that not only was Bolivia right to be opposed, but that it is also the last spokesman for the most radical opponents.\n\nThis post is part of our special coverage Global Development 2011.",
