They handcuffed Vuk and Verica leading them to prison while children  have been sent in a Mexican and later in an Arab foster family. \n \nVuk Nastic was released on bail of $ 18,000, while his wife was released after six days. \n \nThe children immediately made a statement according which little Damjan made photos while playing with camera. \n \n  Nastić said that the evidence in this was that his son was \"upstairs in the hallway playing and he says something in English to the camera and he plays naked and that lasts for about 5 to 10 seconds and that’s it. And you could hear my voice from the ground floor saying to my wife: Verica, pass me this, or something like that. So the kids were upstairs alone, and we were downstairs and that lasted for ten seconds, no evidence what so ever. Yet they used it to break us and the kids.\" \n\nOn September 1. their attorneys and CPA signed a deal – Nastics will confess their guilt that they are unduly worried about the kids because they are allowed to use the camera while the other two counts will be eliminated.\n \nThe Nastićs have engagged a team of Serbian psychologists, Zoran Milivojević, Žarko Korać and Žarko Trebješanin, that have sent a letter to the California court explaining the cultural differences between Serbia and America. \n \nTrebješanin says that the problem is cultural, and that the Americans should take that into consideration, because their citizens experience the same situation when they are arrested in Arab countries for not wearing a veil over the face, or for bathing in a swim suit. \n \n \"In our culture children are perceived as completely asexual and it isn’t unusual that they take baths with their parents. It is nothing unusual that they are photographed and I believe that everyone has in their family album their own naked photo (as a child), or their child’s. It does not produce any erotic feeling, they are just perceived as little kids. I believe that the Americans must understand those differences. As a nation, we touch, hug and kiss more than some other northern nations,\" says Trebješanin. \n\nThe members of Facebook group “ Podrska porodici Nastic – Support to Nastic family” calls people to post the own naked picture from the childhood as a way of public defiance.
