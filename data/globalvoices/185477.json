As we slowly approach the end of the day, we are also looking at on-line reactions to the event.\n\nMost posts are purely informative. Users of Twitter, and the Polish microblogging engine Blip.pl update their audiences under the hashtag #WOSP (an abbreviation of the event's name in Polish: Wielka Orkiestra Swiątecznej Pomocy). \n\n@yinasshi has done great job in documenting the event on Twitter today:\n\n Go check out http://www.en.wosp.org.pl/.
