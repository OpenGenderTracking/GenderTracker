They handcuffed Vuk and Verica and took them to prison, while the children were sent to live with a Mexican and, later, an Arab foster family.\n\nEventually, Vuk Nastic was released on $18,000 bail; his wife was released six days later. \n \nAccording to a statement issued by the Nastic family, it had been little Damjan who took the photos while playing with the camera, while his parents were downstairs.\n\nOn Sept. 1, the Nastic family's attorneys and the CPA signed a deal, according to which the Nastics were guilty of negligence (because they allowed their children to use the camera), while the other charges were eliminated.\n \nThe Nastics have engaged a team of Serbian psychologists, who sent a letter to the California court explaining cultural differences between Serbia and the United States: \"In our culture children are perceived as completely asexual and it isn’t unusual that they take baths with their parents. It is nothing unusual that they are photographed and I believe that everyone has in their family album their own naked photo (as a child), or their child’s.

They let her out the same night because the prosecutor dismissed the case as unfounded, but social \"workers\" besieged the house for a few days until I called a lawyer from \"Civil Rights.\" We paid them about $850 and they threatened them (the social service), after which the case was closed.
