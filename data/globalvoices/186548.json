  "body": "Inspired by protests in Tunisia, the Jordanian Twitter community rallied around a \"Day of Anger,\" announced January 12th and held January 14th after Friday prayers.  The rallies were held around Jordan, focusing primarily on rising prices, but also addressing political disenfranchisement and concerns with Prime Minister Samir Rifai's government.  \n\nReports estimated approximately 400 people in each of the cities of Amman, Irbid and Karak, with about 200 protesters in the city of Dhiban.  These protests were held despite price decreases on several food staples announced this week.  The protests were organized by Baathist and leftist opposition parties, but they were widely discussed and anticipated by unaffiliated members of the Jordanian public under the Twitter hashtag #angryJordan.  \n\nAli  announced on January 12th:\n\n\n\n Let's express our opinions.
