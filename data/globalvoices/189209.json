The government officer was from Malegaon and the incident took place in Manmad, in Maharashtra's Nashik district. As the news broke, netizens reacted with shock and outrage.\n\nBlogger Urmishtha wrote on her blog:\n It was a shocking news to watch sometime back about Additional DC Yashwant Sonawane's brutal murder! The First Additional DC of the Malegaon District in Nashik was burnt alive by the oil mafia while he was on duty.\n\nSomething is terribly going wrong with the mindsets and attitude of people, and especially with the law and order situation of not only any state but the entire nation. Cities which were known as  the faces of their cultural, economic, traditional heritage and  progress; are gradually losing their identity and are now gaining a  status for all the wrong reasons. Nashik is now a city popularly known as home for the oil and kerosene mafia of the state!\n\nYashwant Sonawane, who was on his way for a meeting to some other place, sensed someting fishy goings-on at a place somewhere 10kms away from Manmad. He  immediately went to check at the spot and saw the oil marketeers involved in adulterating. The magnitude of this racket seems to be so  strengthened and their conscience so dead, that they burnt alive this officer!\n\nAn officer of such stature, when is on his way to  perform his duties, was brutally murdered in broad daylight! And, it is a shame that such an incident should occur just a day before when we are all set to celebrate the biggest day of our democracy - our 61st  Republic Day!\n\nIndranil Khan at World of 22.com wrote the following:\n\n Yashwant Sonawane has conducted raids in the petroleum black market flourishing in Maharashtra and had to pay for his honesty by sacrificing his life while raiding the oil depot.
