The 36-year-old protester's death was caused by inhalation of tear gas fired by the Israeli Defense Forces.  Bilin is a village situated directly on the Israeli-built security fence.  Israel has subsequently claimed that tear gas did not cause the woman's death, though tweets from eyewitnesses corroborate extensive use of tear gas.  The Jerusalem Post further published an article on January 5th supporting claims that Abu Rahma was killed by tear gas.\n\nOn January 7th, 2011, Palestinian women gathered in Bilin for a vigil in remembrance of Abu Rahma.
