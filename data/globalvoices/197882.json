A similar accident occurred In April 2009 at Mbagala Army depot and killed at least 26 people. Tanzanian bloggers and twitterers react. \n\nIn a post titled Gongo la Mboto Blasts – A Glimpse, blogger Deogratias Simba posts photographs of fleeing masses, bomb shells and shattered buildings taken on the streets. He writes: \n\n […]\n2. The country’s disaster preparedness programme is very weak (if not absent) … handling proved to be REACTIVE rather than PROACTIVE … the photos will tell you why.\n\n3. It is important to ensure that there is a single commanding voice when it comes to giving instructions of what people should do and when … the media has to be used effectively to convey one central message … not contradictory ones … important for commanding authority and receive the desired outcome.\n\n4. While this incident is being handled and everyone recovering from the shock, our attention on key national issues (Dowans, the new constitution) should be kept very much vivid.\n\n5. TANESCO should improve their efficiency during such incidents … once it takes place … they have to undertake a close inspection of their distribution grids to ensure that they are in order … electricity should be restored the soonest … no reason for people to wait longer than five (5) hours …\n\n6. This should never repeat … pleeease!\n[...]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_197901\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"375\" caption=\"Classroom hit by bomb at Pugu Secondary School. Photo by Deogratias Simba\"][/caption]\n\nBlogger Issa Michuzi also posted photos of the  mayhem that followed the blasts. Several readers send condolences and demand answers from the government [sw]. One reader, Mohammed Bilal says:\n\n We are very sorry for the ones who are directly or indirectly affected by the tragedy!!\nI think ministerial responsibility must take place now… we expected that, after the Mbagala bombing, the army would have taken steps forward to ensure they counter-check the rest of the camps country-wide… but the recent bombing it is evident they did not do so…!! We expect the resignation of the minister responsible!!!\n\nAnother reader remembers arms depot explosion two years ago and wonders why no lessons were learned [sw]:\n\n Inasikitisha sana yaliotokea mbagala haikuwa fundisho, na pia hata yaliyotokea mbagala yalikuwa ni uzembe, sasa kwa haya ya Gongo la Mboto sijui hata tuseme nini, maana ni zaidi ya uzembe, kutojali maisha ya watu,kupuuzia kila kitu, ubinafsi, kutowajibika, kutoipenda nchi na pia kutojali wananchi. Maafa ni makubwa sana ingawa si rahisi kusema ukweli. Wakipoteza maisha 200 tunaambiwa 20. Uongo kila sehemu…\n\n It is very sad, nothing was learned from what happened in Mbagala [the explosion in 2009], and also what happened in Mbagala was negligence, now I do not know what we can say about Gongo la Mboto [the 2011 incident], because it is more than negligence, disregarding people’s lives, ignoring everything,  selfishness, irresponsibility, lack of patriotism and ignoring citizens. The tragedy is massive even though it is not easy to speak the truth. When 200 lives are lost, we are told it is only 20. Lies everywhere…\n\nAs explosions rocked the city, Twitter users reported about the incident using the hashtag #bombsindar:\n\n@jamiiforums reported: \n\n Breaking News: Ghala la silaha Gongo la Mboto lalipuka!\n Breaking News: Gongo la Mboto arms depot explodes!\n\n@katebomz retweeted a photograph of the explosion. \n\nFrustrated and hungry for an explanation or an official response on national television, Twitter users decided to organize relief efforts for the victims:\n\n\n@tzshafiq compared the current government’s response to that of 1996 government: \n\n Mwaka 1996 wakati inatokea ajali ya MV Bukoba nakumbuka Mh. Mkapa hakuchukua muda mrefu kutoa taarifa kwa wananchi kueleza chanzo cha ajali\n In 1996 when MV Bukoba capsized I remember Hon. Mkapa did not take a long time to announce to the people the cause of the accident\n\n@JMakamba criticizes Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation: \n\n On TBC [Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation] now: Boda2Boda music show.
