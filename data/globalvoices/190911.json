The same is happening here. My home away from home, World Cup 2022 hosting country, Qatar, has disappointed me and it hurts. I'm a huge supporter and defender of most all when it comes to this country, so today I fall a bit more silent than usual because I have no answers...\n\nSuch a shame, for up until that moment, Qatar had executed a nearly perfect tournament.
