Tawfik mocks the KFC situation here [ar]:\n هناك عشرات الاتصالات من مواطنين يؤكدون في ذكاء أن المتظاهرين يأكلون (الكنتاكي) وهذا دليل على أن لديهم أجندات خارجية!..  هذا اعتراف ضمني بأنه لا يمكن لواحد من الشعب المصري الآن أن يأكل الكنتاكي ما لم يكن عميلاً للخارج !!\n Tens of phone calls have been received by the television channel, whereby callers made the smart point that they had seen the protesters eating from KFC, and that this was proof that they have foreign agendas. They seem to believe that no one can eat from the American chain without being an agent of foreign forces.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_193755\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"183\" caption=\"They claim that protesters have foreign agendas...

I do not know how Mossad has allied with Hezbollah and Hamas, but the media insists that this has happened.\n\nAlternative truths\n\nThe media have also been playing with the numbers being reported. You can see in the tweets below the differences between the numbers of deaths in protests reported by the Egyptian government, the United Nations and the Al Jazeera television news channel:\n\n @Abdu: Egyptian government says 11 killed in the protests but the UN estimates the number at more than 300. AJ says more than 100\n\nAl Jazeera's coverage has being widely attacked by the Egyptian media. It was even ordered by Egypt's information ministry to shut down its operations in the country last week, and later in the day Al Jazeera's signal to some parts of the Middle East was cut.\n\nEgyptian anchor woman Shahira Amin from state-owned Nile TV resigned in protest over her channel's coverage. Meanwhile, Egyptian blogger Noha Atef, has blamed foreign news channels such as Sky News for sticking too close to Egyptian state television's side of the story:\n\n @NohaAtef: If only @SkyNewsBreak stop quoting #Egypt state TV and look to #Tahrir! Sunday mass is being performed there... yes, on Tharir! #jan25\n\nOnce Egypt was back online last week after a 5-day Internet blackout, people were able to use social media to describe events as they really saw them. Videos like the ones showing a police van that slams into protesters in the streets of Cairo and police forces killing an unarmed Egyptian civilian, are being shared online. Nonetheless it is hard to to compete with traditional media in country where about one third of the population is still illiterate.\n\nHassan Hamed is one of those people who is trying to use his Twitter account to counter claims made by the Egyptian media.\n\n\n @seksek: أنا حاشتغل الصبح و آتظاهر بالليل لحد ما يرحل، مش المتظاهرين اللي وقفوا حال البلد\n\n\n @seksek: I will work in the morning and demonstrate at night till he leaves.

The one who is looking for freedom isn't the one who ruins his country.\n\n\n\n @seksek: والناس اللي مش مصدقة يوم 25 و 26 و 27 كانت أيام شغل، وكان فيه مظاهرات، مأوقفش حال البلد إلا النظام بغباوته\n\n\n @seksek: And for those who do not believe me, on the 25th, 26th and 27th of January, there were protests, people went to their work and life went on normally till the regime intervened.\n\nThis post is part of our special coverage of Egypt Protests 2011.",
