Here are some of her photographs: \n\n[caption id=\"attachment_189304\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"375\" caption=\"This photo is taken by Zeinobia, under creative commons license.\"]\nIn Cairo, tens of thousands of the security forces were seen in the streets since the early morning in their famous black uniform.\n[/caption]\n\nToday is a national holiday in Egypt. The streets were empty. Yet the security forces had their own plans to control the flow of protesters, especially when the usual traffic jams in Cairo's streets are not there to do the natural control of the flow for them.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_189308\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"375\" caption=\"This photo is taken by Zeinobia, under creative commons license.\"]\nThe security forces blocked some of the major squares and intersections in Cairo. Cars were redirected into bridges or tunnels when possible, as it is always harder to demonstrate inside a tunnel, right!? Some users on twitter reported that the underground metro was closed also to control the flow of the protesters.\n[/caption]\n\nRassd New Network published a stunning photo of the protesters in Tahrir Square in Cairo down town on their Facebook page (Update: This photo appears to be a copyrighted Getty image, visit Washington Post to see).\n\nIn the evening, the number of the protesters in El-Tahrir Square became really huge. Midan El-Tahrir or El-Tahrir Square has been the site for numerous major protests and demonstrations, including in March 2003 when people came out to protest the War in Iraq.\n\nTwitter was reported to be blocked in the afternoon. Before that, some people had the chance to upload photographs to services like twitpic. @M_Na7as uploaded the photograph below on his twitpic account showing how the protesters outnumbered the security forces in the city of El-Mahalla. \n\n[caption id=\"attachment_189311\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"375\" caption=\"Photo taken by @M_Na7as\"]\nThe protesters surrounding the security forces in El-Mahalla.

Some of the trucks seen in the streets of Cairo, were in fact coming from less tense governorates in order to offer hand to the local forces. And @alasmari shared a photo of torn pictures of the Egyptian president in one of the billboards on the streets.\n\nMeanwhile, Lebanese web developers Layal Al Khatib and Mirelle Raad developed a new photo aggregator to collect photographs shared by netizens for the protests under one roof. \n\nAfter completing the project, Layal tweeted:\n\n\n\n It was gr8 to work with @migheille for a great cause #jan25.
