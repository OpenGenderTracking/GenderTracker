But the mainstream media and some of the Agorians (: Daum Agora's net users) are busy lauding this as if this feat was solely MB’s (:Korean President’s initials) accomplishment. This kind of attitude makes people shake their heads. Of course, it is not MB’s fault. It is something he had done right. […] But this decision is what any President should be able to make, as the supreme commander and as the head of the state to protect its citizen.[…] The military operation was done successfully not only because MB made a right decision, but also because everyone from concerned departments and each individual from the special forces have managed their parts successfully at the scene without injuring our people.\nWhat concerns Koreans more than bugging news reports is the fact that there are still other Korean crew members who held as hostages by Somali pirates. Net users have filed an online petition[ko] urging the government to rescue seamen from the Guemmi, a Korean vessel hijacked last October.\n\nBlogger Cyberbong 75, even though he titled his post as 'Extremely Amazing Rescue', called for caution about possible revenge.\n 하지만 문제는 이제부터입니다. 90년대 중반 말라카 해협에서 일본의 S사 상선을 공격했던 해적들이 그 배의 선원들에게 진압을 당하여 체포된 이 후 S사의 배가 지나갈 때 마다 해적의 위협에 특히 더 시달려야 했습니다. 해적들에겐 자신들만의 마케팅이라고 할까요. 특유의 리번제 성향이 있기 때문에 당분간은 우리나라 상선에 대한 위협이 더욱 거세일 것입니다. 물론 이런 작전을 몇 번만 더 성공적으로 수행하게 되면 ‘감히 건들어선 안되는 나라의 배'라는 인식을 심어줄 수 있습니다.\n Actually, it is the beginning of the problem. Around the Strait of Malacca, a Japanese vessel that belonged to S (:initial) corporation had been attacked by the pirates in the mid 90's. Those pirates were captured by the crew members and later arrested. But after that incident, any vessel from the S corporation received severe threats from the pirates when they passed through nearby waters. The pirates have their own (marketing) strategies, or a tendency to revenge. The Korean vessels in future will face intensified threats from them. But if we continue to succeed in military operations several more times, they will perceive our vessels ‘as ships from a country we should not dare to touch.’ [note:It is unclear what 'S' stands for but it is true that another Japanese ship was hijacked in 2005 in the Strait of Malacca]\nIn line with this speculation, Reuters reported this morning that Somali pirates have threatened to kill any South Korean seamen that they take hostage in future to pay back the death of their fellow pirates. Pirates from two bases on the Somali coast said they were taking hostages further inland to block future rescue attempts, the report added.\n\nHowever, some bloggers, such as Nest of pnix, reasoned that it is implausible to expect killings from pirates. The blogger explained that since the Somali pirates share a very basic level of camaraderie, the weak emotional bond between pirates will not prevent them from obtaining ransom from countries, which is their top priority.",
