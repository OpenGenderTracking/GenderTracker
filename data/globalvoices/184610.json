Whoever finds a small plastic doll inside their piece of cake will have to buy Mexican food for everybody on February 2nd. Several bloggers have written about this tradition, what it means and how it is celebrated.\n\nThe blog One Lucky Life describes the tradition of the \"King's Cake\":\n \n The  tradition of the famous “king’s cake” with the family is something I  remember since I was a young girl. I would get anxious, as I wanted to  see the little plastic doll inside my piece of cake. For those who might not be familiar with this tradition, I will explain it briefly:\n In  Mexico, on each January 6th, families get together and cut the famous  “Rosca de Reyes”(Literally King’s Cake) , which is a large ring-shaped  cake/bread roll decorated with crystallized fruit and sugar. Inside the  cake you will find mini plastic dolls representing Jesus Christ. Each  member of the family cuts a piece of the cake, and if you a doll inside  your piece, on February 2nd you will have to invite tamales to your family!\n\nMike Gonzales, in the blog New Santa Ana, tells readers why there are plastic dolls representing Jesus Christ inside the cake:\n \n The tradition of placing a trinket (figurine of the Christ Child) in the  cake is very old. The baby Jesus, when hidden in the bread, represents  the flight of Jesus, fleeing from King Herod’s evil plan to kill all  babies that could be the prophesied messiah. Whoever finds the baby  Jesus figurine is blessed and must take the figurine to the nearest  church on February 2, Candlemas Day (Día de la Candelaria). In the  Mexican culture, this person also has to throw a party and provide  tamales and atole to the guests.\n\nIn the blog Nibbles and Feasts, blogger Ericka explains why the person who gets the plastic doll must treat others to Mexican food on February 2nd:\n According to tradition whoever finds the little doll in  their slice of sweet bread must give a party on February 2nd, Candlemas  Day or Dia de la Candelaria, offering tamales, hot chocolate and atole  to their guests. Candlemas is the day that Mary presented the infant  Jesus to the temple and is traditionally the day that candles are  blessed in the Catholic Church.\n[caption id=\"attachment_184615\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"340\" caption=\"Typical \"Rosca de Reyes\" from Mexico image by Flickr user A30_Tsitika  used under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike license\"][/caption]\n\nThe King's Cake recipe can be found at Nibbles and Feasts.\n\nFinally, in 2008, American blogger Joy wrote about the \"King's Cake\" tradition from a foreigner's point of view:\n \n OK, so a Rosca de Reyes cake is really not very strange, it’s just new to me. This weekend is a  festive time in Mexico (long-time readers: You’re learning it’s always a festive time here, aren’t you?) because Jan. 6. is King’s Day (Dia de  Reyes), also known as Epiphany.
